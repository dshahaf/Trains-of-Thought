Others lifted their bare hands high in the air, signifying their support for Mr. Moussavi with green ribbons tied around their wrists or holding their fingers in a victory sign.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The scope and description of the demonstration was provided by participants who were reached by telephone, as well as photographs taken by participants and journalists, despite warnings by the authorities against reporting on the event. All accredited journalists in Iran have been ordered to remain in their offices.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n It was the fifth day of unrest since election officials declared a landslide victory for the incumbent, President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The Iranian Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, summoned the Swiss ambassador, who represents American interests in Tehran, to complain of interventionist statements by American officials, state-run media reported. America and Iran broke off diplomatic relations after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Barack Obama.&quot;&gt;\n  President Obama\n &lt;/a&gt;\n said a day earlier that it would be counterproductive for the United States to be seen as meddling. But he has also said he was deeply troubled by the violence in Iran and that democratic values needed to be observed.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The Iranian Foreign Ministry officials, without being specific about which comments they were reacting to, expressed displeasure, the official IRNA news agency reported. The Canadian charg daffaires was also summoned.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Despite the governments attempts to block communications among the opposition, calls for more mass defiance continued.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In a message on a\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ghalamnews.org&quot; title=&quot;Persian-language Web site&quot;&gt;\n  Web site associated with him\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , Mr. Moussavi called on his supporters to rally again on Thursday, and to go to their local mosques to mourn protesters killed in the demonstrations, officially numbering seven. His call directly challenged Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , who had urged Mr. Moussavi to work through the countrys electoral system in contesting the election results.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Iranians using the Internet messaging service\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/twitter/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Twitter.&quot;&gt;\n  Twitter\n &lt;/a&gt;\n had already spread the word about the silent demonstration   Wednesday.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The sense of threat against the opposition was growing. Reuters reported that Mohammadreza Habibi, the senior prosecutor in the central province of Isfahan, had warned demonstrators that they could be executed under Islamic law.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We warn the few elements controlled by foreigners who try to disrupt domestic security by inciting individuals to destroy and to commit arson that the Islamic penal code for such individuals waging war against God is execution, Mr. Habibi said, according to the Fars news agency. It was not clear if his warning applied only to Isfahan, where there have been violent clashes,  or the country as a whole, Reuters said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The governments new restrictions were directed at blocking communications between opposition supporters and any news coverage of their activities.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The Associated Press reported that the powerful\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islamic_revolutionary_guard_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&quot;&gt;\n  Revolutionary Guards\n &lt;/a&gt;\n threatened to restrict the digital online media that many Iranians use to communicate among themselves and to send news of their protests overseas. In a first statement since last Fridays vote, the Revolutionary Guards said Wednesday that Iranian Web site operators and bloggers must remove content deemed to create tension or face legal action, The A.P. said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In Paris, Soazig Dollet, a spokeswoman for\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rsf.org/-Anglais-.html&quot; title=&quot;Web site&quot;&gt;\n  Reporters Without Borders\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , a press freedom advocacy group, said at least 11 reporters had been arrested since the elections and the fate of 10 more was unclear since they may either be in hiding or under arrest.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On its Web site, the organization said Aldolfatah Soltani, a lawyer and human rights activist, had been detained along with 10 or so opposition activists, politicians and civil society figures in Tehran and three other cities  Tabriz, Isfahan and Shiraz.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Tuesday, the government revoked press credentials for foreign journalists and ordered journalists not to report from the streets. On Wednesday, government officials telephoned or sent faxes to reporters in Tehran working for foreign news organizations ordering them not to venture outside to cover events being held without an official permit. That included rallies by supporters of Mr. Moussavi and news conferences or other public events held without the governments approval, reporters in Tehran said. At least one newspaper has stopped printing.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Government officials told journalists that they were at risk on the streets following an incident on Tuesday when a photographer was stabbed and wounded while covering a rally. Two well-known analysts, Sayeed Leylaz and Mohammad-Reza Jalaipour, were detained Wednesday and were likely to be held for several days, associates and family members said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Defying the restrictions,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8104848.stm&quot; title=&quot;BBC Clip of Amateur Video&quot;&gt;\n  new amateur video surfaced\n &lt;/a&gt;\n outside of Iran on Wednesday, apparently showing a government militia rampaging through a dormitory area of Tehran University late Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Support for the protests came from some unusual quarters. Five Iranian soccer players, including the captain, Ali Karimi,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8105722.stm&quot; title=&quot;BBC Video Clip of Iranian Soccer Team&quot;&gt;\n  wore green wristbands\n &lt;/a&gt;\n in an apparent sign of support for Mr. Moussavi at a World Cup Asian qualifying match in South Korea, The A.P. said, quoting state television.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The Fars news agency also reported that the partial recount of votes ordered Tuesday by the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/guardian_council_iran/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Guardian Council.&quot;&gt;\n  Guardian Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , the 12-member body of jurists which supervises elections and holds veto power over legislation in Iran, had begun. A recount of votes in Kermanshah, a Kurdish province, showed that there has been no irregularity, the news agency reported.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The recount, intended as a effort to meet the oppositions concerns, has failed to halt the unrest. On Tuesday, a large protest by thousands of supporters of Mr. Moussavi stretched for miles along a major thoroughfare in Tehran. The marchers, dressed largely in black and green, marched mostly in silence, some carrying signs in English asking, Where is my vote?\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Despite the media crackdown, extraordinary accounts about the protests in Tehran and other cities have reached the outside world. On Tuesday, many Web sites posted a wrenching video that purported to show the shooting death of a student in Isfahan in a shooting by pro-government militia members. Other videos showed limp and bleeding demonstrators in Tehran after the unprecedented protests of hundreds of thousands on Monday.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Worry over the future of Iran, a country crucially important for its oil, its proximity to Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, its nuclear program and its ties to extremist groups, spilled over its borders.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In Vienna,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/mohamed_elbaradei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mohamed Elbaradei.&quot;&gt;\n  Mohamed ElBaradei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , the head of the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the United Nations.&quot;&gt;\n  United Nations\n &lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iaea.org&quot; title=&quot;Official Web site&quot;&gt;\n  atomic energy watchdog\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , said in a\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/british_broadcasting_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the BBC.&quot;&gt;\n  BBC\n &lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8104401.stm&quot; title=&quot;BBC video&quot;&gt;\n  interview\n &lt;/a&gt;\n that he believed Iran wanted to develop nuclear weapons technology to be recognized as a major power in the Middle East.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   Nazila Fathi reported from Tehran and Sharon Otterman from New York.

The protesters included many women, who even berated as cowards men who fled the Basijis. There appeared to be tens of thousands of protesters in Tehran, far fewer than the mass demonstrations early last  week, likely because of intimidation.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The street violence appeared to grow more intense as night fell, and there were unconfirmed reports of multiple deaths.

They are out of their minds if they think with bloodshed they can crush the movement.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Obamas statement was his strongest to date on the post-election turmoil in Iran. Saying that each and every innocent life lost would be mourned, he added: Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government. If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect the dignity of its own people and govern through consent, not coercion.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Martin Luther King once said: The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. I believe that. The international community believes that. And right now, we are bearing witness to the Iranian peoples belief in that truth, and we will continue to bear witness.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n White House officials said the Mr. Obama was meeting with senior aides throughout the day to discuss the unfolding situation.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There had been varying reports in the hours leading up to the opposition rally about whether it would be called off in the face of the states threatened crackdown.   State television reported that Mr. Moussavi had in fact called it off, but some of his supporters, posting on social networking sites, urged demonstrators to gather.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Journalists were banned from leaving their offices to report on the protests. A reporter from an American news organization said she had been called by a member of the Basij militia warning her not to go to the venue for the Saturday rally because the situation would be dangerous and there could be fatalities.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The authorities were also reported on Saturday to have renewed an offer of a partial recount of the ballots in the disputed election  an offer that the opposition has previously rejected. A letter published on one of Mr. Moussavis Web sites late Saturday repeated his demand for the election to be annulled.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The Iranian nation will not believe this unjust and illegal act, Mr. Moussavi said in the letter, which was addressed to the powerful\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/guardian_council_iran/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Guardian Council.&quot;&gt;\n  Guardian Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , an authoritative panel of clerics which oversees and certifies election results. Making his case for electoral fraud, he charged that thousands of his representatives had been expelled from polling stations and some mobile polling stations had ballot boxes filled with fake ballots.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In a long and hard-line sermon on Friday, Ayatollah Khamenei declared the June 12 election of President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n valid and warned that demonstration leaders would be responsible for bloodshed and chaos if demonstrations continued.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Regional analysts said that, by calling for an end to the rallies, Ayatollah Khamenei had inserted himself directly into the confrontation, invoking his own prestige and that of Irans clerical regime. But his speech also laid the groundwork to suppress the opposition movement with a harder hand, characterizing further protests as against the Islamic Republic itself.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Irans\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_security_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about National Security Council, U.S.&quot;&gt;\n  National Security Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n reinforced Ayatollah Khameneis warning on Saturday, state media reported, telling Mr. Moussavi to refrain from provoking illegal rallies.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The demand came in a letter from the head of the council after a formal complaint by Mr. Moussavi that law enforcement agencies had failed to protect protesters.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n It is your duty not to incite and invite the public to illegal gatherings; otherwise, you will be responsible for its consequences, the letter said, according to state media.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;pageLinks&quot;&gt;\n &lt;ul id=&quot;pageNumbers&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n   1\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n   &lt;a onclick=&quot;s_code_linktrack(`Article-MultiPagePageNum2`);&quot; title=&quot;Page 2&quot; href=&quot;/2009/06/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html?pagewanted=2&quot; title=&quot;Next Page&quot; href=&quot;/2009/06/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html?pagewanted=2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;NYT_AUTHOR_ID&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div id=&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   This article was written by Robert F.

They were met with riot police and paramilitary militia, who struck at them with truncheons, tear gas and guns. One witness said he saw a 19-year-old woman shot in the neck. Others said the police had shot in the air, not directly at demonstrators.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Some opposition supporters said that presidential candidate and opposition leader\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mir_hussein_moussavi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mir Hussein Moussavi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mir Hussein Moussavi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n had been scheduled to address the crowd, but initial reports indicated that he had not appeared.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The violence came as additional details emerged about the sweeping scale of arrests that have accompanied the nations worst political crisis since the 1979 revolution.

Iranian state media have reported 645 arrests, but the total number of detained may be as high as 2,000, the organization said, citing human rights activists in Iran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Among them are people arrested in a Monday night raid of a campaign office for Mr. Moussavi in Tehran, Press TV, state televisions English-language satellite broadcaster, reported Wednesday. The government said the office was being used as a headquarters for psychological war against the countrys security, and claimed that evidence had been found of the role of foreign elements in planning post-election unrest.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Also detained are 102 political figures, 23 journalists, 79 university students and 7 university faculty, the human rights organization said. By official reckonings, at least 17 demonstrators have been killed.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Earlier Wednesday, Ayatollah Khamenei told legislators that he insisted and will insist on implementing the law on the election issue, according to accounts in the state-run media. Neither the establishment nor the nation will yield to pressure at any cost.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Coupled with the clampdown on the new demonstration, arrests and other developments, the Ayatollahs comments reinforced the impression that the authorities have resolved to use all levers of power to choke off protest.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The coalition opposed to the election results suffered a setback Wednesday when one candidate formally withdrew his complaints of vote-rigging, opening a rift among those who had challenged the outcome of the June 12 election.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Some opponents maintained their defiance, calling for continued protests and the release of detainees. Despite efforts to silence dissent and despite an appearance of disarray in opposition ranks,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/zahra_rahnavard/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Zahra Rahnavard.&quot;&gt;\n  Zahra Rahnavard\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , Mr. Moussavis wife who has played an influential role in the opposition, issued a call Wednesday for the immediate release of Iranians detained in election protests, his Web site reported.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n I regret the arrest of many politicians and people and want their immediate release, Ms. Rahnavard declared. It is my duty to continue legal protests to preserve Iranian rights.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The candidate who withdrew his complaint of election fraud, Mohsen Rezai, had initially complained that while the official count gave him 680,000 votes, he had evidence that 900,000 people voted for him. But on Wednesday, Press TV reported, he decided to abandon the complaint, saying the current political, social and security situation has entered a sensitive and decisive phase which is more important than the election.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Trailing Mr. Moussavi and the former Parliament speaker, Mehdi Karroubi, Mr. Rezai was the most conservative of the losing candidates and had been under strong pressure from Irans rulers to pull back from the confrontation.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Rezai was quoted as calling the ballot a clear sample of religious democracy, sharing language with a powerful defense of the ballot in a sermon last Friday by Ayatollah Khamenei.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Rezais decision to withdraw, regional analysts said, represented an incremental but significant step back for the opposition, since his status as being part of and loyal to the system adding credibility to the overall electoral challenge.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The electoral controversy continued to boil, spilling over Irans own borders, as\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Barack Obama.&quot;&gt;\n  President Obama\n &lt;/a&gt;\n issued on Tuesday his harshest condemnation of events there yet, saying he was appalled and outraged by the attacks on civilian protesters.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n I strongly condemn these unjust actions, Mr. Obama said during a news conference at the White House.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Irans leadership pressed its own charges that foreign powers had meddled in its internal affairs and instigated the widespread protests. State television showed people identified as protesters saying they had been influenced by foreign news media, Reuters reported.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n I think we were provoked by networks like the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/british_broadcasting_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the BBC.&quot;&gt;\n  BBC\n &lt;/a&gt;\n and the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/v/voice_of_america/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Voice of America&quot;&gt;\n  Voice of America\n &lt;/a&gt;\n to take such immoral actions, one young man said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The government has also worked to underscore that it is under attack by terrorists seeking to take advantage of the post-election turmoil. Press TV, quoting the national intelligence minister, said Wednesday that dozens of alleged terrorists have been arrested in the past week, including suspects in the alleged bombing last Saturday of the shine of Ayatollah Imam Khomeini in Tehran that wounded three.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The arrested were linked with the Zionist and non-Zionist regimes outside the county, the intelligence minister, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, was quoted as saying. Britain announced it had expelled two Iranian diplomats in a tit-for-tat response to Irans decision a day earlier to expel two British diplomats. Iran also lashed out at the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the United Nations.&quot;&gt;\n  United Nations\n &lt;/a&gt;\n secretary general,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/ban_ki_moon/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ban Ki-moon.&quot;&gt;\n  Ban Ki-moon\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , for his call to end arrests, threats and use of force.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Irans foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said on Wednesday Tehran was reviewing whether to downgrade ties with Britain, which Iran has accused of interference in its disputed presidential election, the ISNA semi-official news agency said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We are reviewing this issue, Manouchehr Mottaki said, according to ISNA.

It said the embassy employees played a significant role in organizing the protests, which have reached across the country and across social and economic lines.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Tehran also continued to charge journalists with working as agents of discord, publishing one editors confession while continuing to keep others behind bars without charge or barred from working.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The arrests, detentions and restrictions added to Irans growing international isolation, as\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the European Union.&quot;&gt;\n  European Union\n &lt;/a&gt;\n foreign ministers meeting in Corfu, Greece, warned in a statement that there would be a strong and collective EU response to any intimidation of its members diplomatic staffs. The British foreign ministry said some of its personnel had been released, but declined to provide details.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In the past, international pressure was enough to rally the nation behind its leaders and silence critics. But this time, that did not seem to be the case. Instead, the leaderships actions, coupled with renewed calls for national unity, added to a growing sense of uncertainty over where Iran was headed as its leaders tried to pull out of a crisis that has undermined its legitimacy and divided the political and clerical elite.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In spite of all the threats, the overwhelming show of force and the nighttime raids on private homes, protesters still flowed into the streets by the thousands on Sunday to demonstrate in support of Mr. Moussavi.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Moussavi, who has had little room to act but has refused to fold under government pressure, had earlier received a permit to hold a ceremony at the Ghoba mosque to honor Mohammad Beheshti, one of the founders of the 1979 revolution who died in a bombing on June 28, 1981, that killed dozens of officials. Mr. Moussavi used the anniversary as a pretense to call a demonstration, and by midday the streets outside the elaborately tiled mosque were filled with protesters, their arms jabbing the air, their fingers making a V symbol, for victory.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The demonstrators wore black, to mourn the 17 protesters killed by government-aligned forces, and chanted Allah Akbar, or God is great.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There was a sea of people and the crowed stretched a long way onto the main street on Shariati, said one witness, who remained anonymous because he feared retribution.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n What started as a peaceful demonstration turned into a scene of violence and chaos by late Sunday, witnesses said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Some described scenes of brutality, telling The Associated Press that some protesters suffered broken bones and alleging that police beat an elderly woman, prompting a screaming match with young demonstrators who then fought back. The reports could not be independently verified because of tight restrictions imposed on journalists in Iran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The leadership seems to recognize that ending the street demonstrations is far easier that turning the clock back to the days before the election, when there was still some degree of trust in a system that sought to marry religious authority with popularly elected institutions, political analysts said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n I think no one can predict Irans political future, said an Iranian intellectual who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal. I do believe some things have changed after this recent upheaval and that events will play out in months and years to come.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , who has ruled out any compromise with the opposition, said Sunday that the only solution to the crisis was to follow legal procedures. And he urged political leaders not to be what he called tools of foreign influence, returning to a theme of foreign intervention that historically has resonated across Iran but that so far has so far failed to silence the opposition.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n If the nation and political elite are united in heart and mind, the incitement of international traitors and oppressive politicians will be ineffective, he said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In spite of the unrelenting pressure of the state, including threats that protesters should be jailed and even killed, there were still high-ranking insiders who refused to endorse the governments narrative. They were not agitating for the opposition  or even for defiance  but by carefully not endorsing the leadership, were seen as challenging it, political analysts said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n As one colleague said, the train has left the station, and I dont think even the leaders of the country know exactly where it is heading, said Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian history at St. Andrews University in Scotland.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The former two-time president,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/ali_akbar_hashemi_rafsanjani/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , a bitter opponent of President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , made his first public remarks on Sunday, also under cover of a ceremony honoring the martyrs of 1981. His comments suggested support for the publics actions.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The recent events were a complex plot by suspicious elements that wanted to create a gap between people and the establishment and was aimed at people to lose their confidence in the establishment, he said, according to the ILNA news agency.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n He added: Whenever people have entered the scene such plots have been neutralized.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The leadership has maintained its two-track approach to the national disturbance that began shortly after the polls closed on June 12. It has ordered its security forces, including the police and the basiji militia, to frighten, beat and detain opposition figures  as well as independent-minded citizens and journalists not involved in the protests or political activities. It also has tried to offer an alternate route for resolving the dispute by asking the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/guardian_council_iran/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Guardian Council.&quot;&gt;\n  Guardian Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , responsible for monitoring the elections, to set up a review committee to include representatives of the opposition candidates.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But the opposition, led by Mr. Moussavi, has rejected the call, noting that the Guardian Council has earlier indicated its support for Mr. Ahmadinejad  and has twice said that there were no signs of rampant fraud and that it would not nullify the outcome. The council is scheduled to certify the election as valid any day.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Instead, Mr. Moussavi sent a letter to the Guardian Council calling for the creation of an arbitration committee to probe what he says are widespread irregularities. He repeated his belief that nullifying the disputed vote would be the most appropriate solution and a means to rebuild public confidence.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   This article was written by Michael Slackman in Cairo based on reports from Tehran.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_author_id&gt;\n&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<node id="n5004">\n<data key="x">0.295180722892</data>\n<data key="y">0.5</data>\n<data key="label">Iran Council Certifies Disputed Election Results</data>\n<data key="date">2009-06-29</data>\n<data key="dummy">0</data>\n<data key="text">&lt;p&gt;\n CAIRO\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot;

The government went to far as to extend a deadline for considering complaints of vote rigging  just hours before confirming the vote.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n When news of the certification broke, witnesses said, security and militia forces flooded the streets, and protesters who were already out marching down Tehrans central avenue, Vali Asr, broke into furious chants. Other Iranians, urged on by Web site pleas, went to their rooftops to yell God is great! in a show of defiance.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The government has barred all independent coverage of events in Iran, jailing hundreds of journalists and revoking the credentials of hundreds more.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Earlier Monday, state television said the Guardian Council had begun a random recount of 10 percent of the ballots in Tehrans 22 electoral districts and in some provinces. Opposition candidates refused to participate by sending observers, and the recount aroused new skepticism when the official news agency IRNA said that in one district, the hardline incumbent,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n ,  had won even more votes than in the first official count.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Monday night, state media suddenly announced that the Guardian Council had  finished the recount and officially confirmed the declared landslide for Mr. Ahmadinejad.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, the Guardian Councils secretary, sent a letter to the interior minister saying the panel had approved the election after a partial recount, according to state television.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n At the same time,  a growing number of officials under the supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , and Mr. Ahmadinejad appeared to be trying to resolve the internal dispute by shifting some blame to foreign powers, including\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/unitedkingdom/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More news and information about United Kingdom.&quot;&gt;\n  Britain\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , and by continuing reliance  on the hammer-fisted policy of dispatching police and militia members to beat protesters.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of Parliament was scheduled to visit the holy city of Qom on Monday to meet with two grand ayatollahs.

I think this anger and discontent right now might have been managed and controlled, it might not erupt again in the next two days or week. But it has not been resolved.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The nations intelligence chief charged that the protests were inspired by Western and Zionist forces, and President Ahmadinejad called for an investigation into the killing of\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/neda_agha_soltan/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Neda Agha-Soltan.&quot;&gt;\n  Neda Agha Soltan\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , pressing the governments contention that the young woman who has become an icon of government repression of protesters was killed by a foreign agent.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n A day earlier, the authorities arrested nine Iranian  employees of the British Embassy. While five had been released Monday, four remained for what the intelligence service said were efforts to incite and organize the protests.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The intelligence minister, Gholamhussein Mohseini Ejei, was quoted as saying that Iran had videotaped evidence that local employees of the British Embassy were present at the scene of clashes, and he suggested they could face trial.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We should wait and see what will happen to them later with the cooperation of the judiciary, he said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Irans economy, even before the electoral crisis, was suffering from the drop in oil prices, inflation of at least 15 percent  by some estimates 25 percent  and damaging unemployment. On Sunday, the government announced that it had to end all subsidies for gasoline used by private vehicles, a decision that was not unexpected but given the timing suggested serious strains to the state budget.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Antagonizing Britain, when the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the European Union.&quot;&gt;\n  European Union\n &lt;/a&gt;\n is Irans  largest trading partner,  could  add further damage. There was already some indication that some  of those close to the supreme leader were growing anxious over the state of the nation. European security experts, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, confirmed reports in Italian and Turkish newspapers that  large sums of money in banks controlled by the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islamic_revolutionary_guard_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&quot;&gt;\n  Revolutionary Guard\n &lt;/a&gt;\n were being sent out of Iran to safe havens.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The Guardian Council, a 12-member clerical panel, also said on Monday that the defeated presidential candidate,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mir_hussein_moussavi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mir Hussein Moussavi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mir Hussein Moussavi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , had offered proposals to rebuild public trust. Press TV, the English-language state satellite broadcaster, said the council had found Mr. Moussavis proposals to be positive, the first constructive interaction between Mr. Moussavi and the council since election day.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But it was also clear that some of the nations most powerful people were taking the long view of the conflict, avoiding a direct conflict with the leadership while still not letting it off the hook. Mr. Rafsanjani, a powerful billionaire cleric who has challenged the direction Mr. Ahmadinejad and Mr. Khamenei have taken the country, issued his first remarks since the election on Sunday.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n I hope those involved in this matter can precisely observe fairness and justice, and in cooperation with the candidates, so that complaints can be addressed completely, a statement that offered his subtle refusal to accept a half-hearted review.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   This article was written by Michael Slackman in Cairo and Alan Cowell in Paris, based on reports from Tehran.

The visit would have taken him out of the country at a sensitive time, although he showed no such hesitation immediately after the election when he was welcomed  to  a regional summit in Russia as protests began to build at home.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Since then, though, Tehrans streets have witnessed mass rallies of defiant protesters and a increasingly violent official crackdown on them.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n As the government seeks to finally extinguish the protest, police officers and militia forces crowded the streets of Tehran on Tuesday, setting up checkpoints and making clear that the government had zero tolerance for any further public expressions of defiance. The move came a day after\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More news and information about Iran.&quot;&gt;\n  Iran\n &lt;/a&gt;\n s powerful\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/guardian_council_iran/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Guardian Council.&quot;&gt;\n  Guardian Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n certified Mr. Ahmadinejads landslide victory.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There were signs on Wednesday that the authorities were still trying to pin responsibility for the post-election unrest on western interference. The Iranian police arrested nine local employees of the British Embassy in Tehran at the weekend and some of them are still being held.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n One of them, the semi-official Fars news agency said Wednesday, had a remarkable role during the recent unrest in managing it behind the scenes. It put the number of embassy personnel still held at three. Earlier reports said four were still in custody.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There were also new indications that the authorities would not tolerate   further dissent from any quarter. After Mehdi Karroubi, a former parliament speaker who came a distant fourth in the June 12 vote, said on his Web site Tuesday that he did not recognize the legitimacy of the ballot, the authorities reportedly barred publication of his party newspaper on Wednesday, news reports said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The official results showed Mr. Karroubi winning just a few hundred thousand votes compared to Mr. Ahmadinejads majority of almost two thirds of what was described as an 85 percent turnout. The second place contender, former Prime Minister\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mir_hussein_moussavi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mir Hussein Moussavi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mir Hussein Moussavi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , won about a third of the votes, and has demanded a new election because of what he says was massive electoral fraud.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Karroubis Web site late Tuesday quoted him as saying he did not consider the government legitimate and  I will continue my fight using every means and Im ready to cooperate with pro-reform people and groups.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n By contrast, after the certification of the ballot by the Guardian Council, Parliament issued a statement expressing broad gratitude over the vote and thanking the police and the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/basij_militia/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Basij militia.&quot;&gt;\n  Basij\n &lt;/a&gt;\n militia for maintaining security. Mr. Ahmadinejad visited the Ministry of Intelligence, where he gave a speech to employees.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The government crushed the vast protests following the vote, dispatching armed militia and police officers and leaving an estimated 17 people dead and hundreds injured. The authorities continued to detain hundreds of journalists, former government officials, political activists and even independent researchers, in the quest to prevent any further demonstrations.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There seemed little prospect of any chance for organized and sustained action against the governments version of events, political analysts said, in part because the arrests had starved the opposition of leadership, foot soldiers and an effective means to communicate.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n One of the most recent arrests, of Bijan Khajehpour, an independent political economist, sent a chill deeper yet into Irans civil society because he had not been involved in the opposition demonstrations, political analysts said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Khajehpour had been detained at the airport coming into the country from Britain, and like many others, has disappeared into the notorious Evin prison, raising concerns over the scope of the crackdown and the prospect of a political purge, the analysts said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Bijan was perhaps the last independent-minded analyst living in Tehran who continued to travel to Europe and the U.S. and give open lectures about Iran, said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He always believed that if he was totally transparent, the government would understand he was not doing anything wrong.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The government has also, over the past several days, fired high-ranking officials who had supported Mr. Moussavi, according to Iranian news reports.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Human rights groups said arrests had taken place around the nation, but there were particular fears that those held at Evin were in physical danger.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;pageLinks&quot;&gt;\n &lt;ul id=&quot;pageNumbers&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n   1\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n   &lt;a onclick=&quot;s_code_linktrack(`Article-MultiPagePageNum2`);&quot; title=&quot;Page 2&quot; href=&quot;/2009/07/02/world/middleeast/02iran.html?pagewanted=2&quot; title=&quot;Next Page&quot; href=&quot;/2009/07/02/world/middleeast/02iran.html?pagewanted=2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;NYT_AUTHOR_ID&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div id=&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   Michael Slackman reported from Cairo, and Alan Cowell from Paris.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_author_id&gt;\n&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<node id="n5274">\n<data key="x">0.491967871486</data>\n<data key="y">0.3</data>\n<data key="label">Iran Security Forces Move to Crush Renewed Protests</data>\n<data key="date">2009-07-09</data>\n<data key="dummy">0</data>\n<data key="text">&lt;p&gt;\n CAIRO  Thousands of Iranians poured into the streets of Tehran on Thursday, clapping, chanting, almost mocking the authorities as they once again turned out in large numbers in defiance of the governments threat to crush their protests with violence.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;articleInline&quot; class=&quot;inlineLeft&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;inlineBox&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;#secondParagraph&quot; class=&quot;jumpLink&quot;&gt;\n   Skip to next paragraph\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;div id=&quot;sidebarArticles&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;h4&gt;\n    Related\n   &lt;/h4&gt;\n   &lt;h2&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/latest-updates-on-iran-election-protests/index.html?ref=middleeast&quot;&gt;\n     The Lede: Latest Updates on Iran Election Protests\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n    (July 9, 2009)\n   &lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;a name=&quot;secondParagraph&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n As tear gas canisters cracked and hissed in the middle of crowds, and baton-wielding police officers chased up and down sidewalks,  young people, some bloodied, ran for cover, and there was an almost festive feeling on the streets of Tehran, witnesses reported.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n A young woman, her clothing covered in blood, ran up Kagar Street, paused for a minute and said, I am not scared because we are in this together.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The protesters lighted trash on fire in the street, and shopkeepers locked their gates, then let demonstrators in to escape the wrath of the police. Hotels also served as safe havens, letting in protesters and locking out the authorities. It has been almost four weeks since the polls closed and the government announced that President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n had won re-election in a landslide.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n And it has been almost four weeks of defiance, in the face of the governments repeated, uncompromising and violent efforts to restore the status quo. The government did succeed in keeping people off the streets the last 11 days, leaving many to simmer on their own as political insiders and clerical heavyweights slugged it out behind the scenes.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But there was an opening to take to the streets again on Thursday, in a collective show of defiance, and many protesters seized it, even though the principal opposition leaders stayed away.\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mir_hussein_moussavi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mir Hussein Moussavi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mir Hussein Moussavi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , who claims he won the election, Mehdi Karroubi and the former president\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/mohammad_khatami/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mohammad Khatami.&quot;&gt;\n  Mohammad Khatami\n &lt;/a&gt;\n have agreed to pursue their complaints through the legal system, and to protest only when a permit is issued.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But the mood of the street never calmed. One witness said that if it had not been for the  overwhelming show of force, it appeared that tens of thousands were prepared to turn out.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The day was supercharged from the start, with a protest called for 4 p.m. to honor the students who 10 years earlier were bloodied and   jailed during a violent confrontation with the police. Under a hot summer sun, police officers in riot gear patrolled the streets in roving bands of about 50. Then the crowds started to form, men, women and children packing the sidewalks. Traffic stopped and drivers honked or stepped from their cars in solidarity. The people chanted Down with the Dictator,  God is Great and Mouss-a-vi  as they walked along Revolution Street.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n It was almost festive.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Tell the world what is happening here, one 26-year-old engineering student  said. This is our revolution. We will not give up.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Asked what he wanted, he said: We want democracy.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n One witness gave this account: The crowds are too huge to contain. Riot police running up and down Fatemi Street, beating people, barely got out of the way. The crowds just get out of their way and come back.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There were scenes like that reported all over the city, though the main skirmishes seemed to have occurred near Tehran University and at Enghelab Square. Police shot tear gas into Laleh Park. As night fell, the scene grew more severe. The  air filled with acrid smoke and soot, and police officers and\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/basij_militia/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Basij militia.&quot;&gt;\n  Basij\n &lt;/a&gt;\n militia members ran  along the streets.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n A man in a business suit pulled out a collapsible baton and beat a person with a camera until the baton broke. A middle-aged woman ran through the crowd, her coat covered with blood stains. Protesters hurled rocks at security officers.  Two men held a huge floral arrangement of yellow and purple flowers on green leaves in commemoration of those killed last month and in 1999, a witness said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But still, no matter who stopped to talk, witnesses said, there was a sense of mission and unity that seemed almost validated by the brutal government response. A 55-year-old woman on the streets in support of the marchers said: This is\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More news and information about Iran.&quot;&gt;\n  Iran\n &lt;/a&gt;\n . We are all together.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The security forces did not fire on protesters, witnesses said, and it was unclear how many people were injured or arrested. Until now, the government has relied on three main tactics to try to put the turbulence of the presidential race behind it: detentions;  the violent suppression of street protests;  and shifting blame to meddling foreign nations, primarily Britain and the United States, but also Israel and Saudi Arabia, for fomenting the unrest.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The nations supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , has sanctified the election,  and the powerful\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/guardian_council_iran/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Guardian Council.&quot;&gt;\n  Guardian Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n has certified the results. But the opposition has continued to insist that there were widespread irregularities rendering the vote and the results invalid. They have refused to concede, which has served to keep the conflict from fading .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Cell phone messaging was disconnected Thursday for a third consecutive day, apparently to prevent communication between protesters. The government also closed the universities and declared an official holiday Tuesday and Wednesday, ostensibly because Tehran has been shrouded in a cloud of heavy dust and pollution.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But neither the announced holiday nor the murky air  seemed to  thin the crowds.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Many people thrust their hands into the air, making the vee sign for victory.

Hotels also served as havens, letting in protesters and locking out the authorities.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The security forces did not fire on protesters, witnesses said, and it was unclear how many people were injured or arrested. On Friday, the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran cited witnesses saying that dozens of people had been detained and many injured in beatings by police and militia forces.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n It has been almost four weeks since the polls closed and the government announced that President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n had won re-election in a landslide.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n And there have been almost four weeks of defiance, in the face of the governments repeated, uncompromising and violent efforts to restore the status quo. The government did succeed in keeping people off the streets in the previous 11 days, leaving many to simmer on their own as political insiders and clerical heavyweights slugged it out behind the scenes.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But there was an opening to take to the streets again on Thursday in a collective show of defiance, and many protesters seized it, even though the principal opposition leaders stayed away.\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mir_hussein_moussavi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mir Hussein Moussavi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mir Hussein Moussavi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , who claims he won the election; another candidate, Mehdi Karroubi; and former President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/mohammad_khatami/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mohammad Khatami.&quot;&gt;\n  Mohammad Khatami\n &lt;/a&gt;\n have agreed to pursue their complaints through the legal system and to protest only when a permit is issued.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But the mood of the street never calmed. One witness said that had it not been for the overwhelming show of force, it appeared, tens of thousands would have turned out.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The day was supercharged from the start, with a protest called for 4 p.m. to honor the students who 10 years earlier were bloodied and jailed during a violent confrontation with the police.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Under a hot summer sun, police officers in riot gear patrolled the streets in roving bands of about 50. Then the crowds started to form, men, women and children packing the sidewalks. Traffic stopped and drivers honked or stepped from their cars in solidarity. The people chanted, Down with the dictator, God is great and Mouss-a-vi as they walked along Revolution Street.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Tell the world what is happening here, one 26-year-old engineering student said. This is our revolution. We will not give up.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Asked what he wanted, he said, We want democracy.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n One witness gave this account: The crowds are too huge to contain. Riot police running up and down Fatemi Street, beating people, barely got out of the way. The crowds just get out of their way and come back.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Scenes like that were reported all over the city, though the main skirmishes seemed to have occurred near Tehran University and at Revolution Square. The police shot tear gas into Laleh Park. As night fell, the scene grew more severe. The air filled with acrid smoke and soot, and police officers and\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/basij_militia/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Basij militia.&quot;&gt;\n  Basij\n &lt;/a&gt;\n militia members ran along the streets.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n A man in a business suit pulled out a collapsible baton and beat a person who had a camera until the baton broke. A middle-age woman ran through the crowd, her coat covered with blood stains. Protesters hurled rocks at security officers. Two men held a huge arrangement of yellow and purple flowers on green leaves, in commemoration of those killed last month and in 1999, a witness said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But still, no matter who stopped to talk, witnesses said, there was a sense of mission and unity that seemed almost validated by the brutal government response. A 55-year-old woman on the streets in support of the marchers said: This is Iran. We are all together.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Until now, the government has relied on three main tactics to try to put the turbulence of the presidential race behind it: detentions; the violent suppression of street protests; and a shifting of blame for the unrest to meddling foreign nations, primarily Britain and the United States, but also Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The nations supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , has sanctified the election, and the powerful\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/guardian_council_iran/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Guardian Council.&quot;&gt;\n  Guardian Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n has certified the results. But the opposition has continued to insist that there were widespread irregularities, rendering the vote and the results invalid. It has refused to concede, which has served to keep the conflict from fading.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Cellphone messaging was disconnected Thursday for a third consecutive day, apparently to prevent communication among protesters. The government also closed universities and declared an official holiday on Tuesday and Wednesday, ostensibly because Tehran has been shrouded in a cloud of heavy dust and pollution.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But neither the announced holiday nor the murky air seemed to thin the crowds.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Many people thrust their hands into the air, making the V-sign for victory. The crowds remained mostly peaceful, a witness said, even as they watched, and sometimes tried to stop, police officers and militia members beating unarmed men and women. Many women were on the street, as they have been throughout the crisis.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n A crowd chanted, Please stop, and chased two Basij members away.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The streets burned with garbage fires. Tear gas settled all around. And on one street, thousands of people pushed on, proclaiming their solidarity and defiance.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We dont want war, said one 27-year-old man in a black shirt.

Severe reporting restrictions in Iran hindered efforts to gauge the scale of the demonstration.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The official IRNA news agency said there was no disturbance of the peace on major streets and traffic circles in the Iranian capital during the inauguration, The Associated Press reported, quoting witnesses as saying at least 10 people were detained by police.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Witnesses said the detainees included protesters in black T-shirts in a show of grief over Mr. Ahmadinejads inauguration, The A.P. said. The state-run broadcaster Press TV said more than 5,000 members of the security and police forces had gathered around the parliament building while officers with sniffer dogs patrolled the area.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In a relatively low-key speech, news reports said, Mr. Ahmadinejad attacked foreign detractors, appealed for national unity, pledged a stronger foreign policy with more effective new plans and said he would spare no effort to safeguard the frontiers of Iran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Speaking from a podium bedecked with yellow flowers, he did not directly allude to the huge street protests that have riven  Iranian society since  opposition leaders accused the authorities of rigging the June 12 election in which Mr. Ahmadinejad was awarded an overwhelming victory. His election was  formally endorsed earlier this week by the countrys supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Wednesday, Mr. Ahmadinejad urged national unity, saying: &quot;We should join hands as we move forward to fulfill our goals, The A.P. reported. He said his government would resist any violation of law and interference.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We will not remain silent, we will not tolerate disrespect, interference and insults, he said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n While his supporters in the ruling elite attended the ceremony, it was boycotted by opposition leaders and reformist legislators, news reports said, while opponents gathered outside to protest his inauguration, despite the presence of hundreds of police officers around the parliament building.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Referring to the western powers, which Tehran has accused of orchestrating the post-election unrest, Mr. Ahmadinejad said: Some countries have not recognized the elections or extended their congratulations. They do not respect the rights of other nations, yet they recognize themselves as the yardstick for democracy, The A.P. reported. Nobody in Iran is waiting for anyones congratulations.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The absence of opposition figures at the inauguration ceremony underscored the persistence of a deep schism among Iranians, and in the ruling hierarchy.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The opposition movement continues to press its claims that Mr. Ahmadinejads landslide victory was rigged, and to muster large street demonstrations. Last weekend, in preparation for the inauguration, the authorities began their latest effort to intimidate the opposition: a mass trial of more than 100 reformists. Some senior opposition figures were shown on state television\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/world/middleeast/03iran.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article&quot;&gt;\n  delivering humiliating confessions\n &lt;/a&gt;\n in which they said there had been no election fraud, and detailing foreign-led plots to bring down the Iranian government with a velvet revolution. Such confessions are familiar from earlier trials, and defendants and human rights groups say they are almost always obtained through torture.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Prosecutors have warned that anyone questioning the legitimacy of the trial  as many opposition figures have  could in turn be prosecuted. Some senior lawmakers have hinted in recent days that\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mir_hussein_moussavi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mir Hussein Moussavi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mir Hussein Moussavi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n and other opposition leaders could be arrested soon, though it is impossible to tell if that is only a scare tactic.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But the opposition does not seem to have been cowed. In recent weeks, as news emerged of protesters who died in prison after being arrested, Mr. Moussavi and others spoke out more forcefully than ever before, accusing the government of savage and criminal acts. The anger spread to prominent conservatives, prompting a number of conciliatory efforts by the government including the release of more than 140 prisoners and the closure  at the personal order of Irans supreme leader  of a controversial detention center.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Such conciliatory gestures have alternated with renewed crackdowns on street protests, with ever-larger deployments of police in Tehran and other cities to intimidate and beat back protesters. But the protests have continued, and even adapted: in recent days the protesters have begun using a new tactic in which they cluster together and chant anti-government slogans, only to disperse quietly into the surrounding crowds the moment the police approach.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The authorities clearly hope that Mr. Ahmadinejads inauguration will put to rest the oppositions persistent demands for an annulment of the election or a referendum on its legitimacy. But it is clear that they are concerned about the continuation of the protests in the weeks and months to come. The start of the school year and the athletic season at summers end will create natural occasions for mass gatherings that could easily turn into opposition rallies, as the leader of the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/basij_militia/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Basij militia.&quot;&gt;\n  Basij\n &lt;/a&gt;\n militia recently warned.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The opposition aside, Mr. Ahmadinejad is likely to face an array of political challenges from his own conservative rivals. A bitter dispute broke out last month when he appointed a controversial figure as his top deputy, and he was forced to back down after Ayatollah Khamenei intervened.

But the agency said that after years of requests, the country still refused to turn over important documents linked to suspicions that its military was  involved in the nuclear program, or to allow the agency to interview key personnel  suspected of roles in weapons development.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The State Department, reacting to the report on Friday evening, said that the report clearly shows that Iran continues to expand its nuclear program and deny the I.A.E.A. most forms of cooperation.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Wednesday, officials from the United States and Europe are to meet to debate proposals for far more severe sanctions against Iran than the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/security_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Security Council, U.N.&quot;&gt;\n  United Nations Security Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n has invoked, with no results, against Tehran for continuing to enrich uranium. One proposal on the table is a cutoff of refined gasoline exported to the country. In advance of  the report, those governments were pressing for the monitoring agency  to publish a  pointed account of the evidence suggesting Iran had weapons ambitions for its nuclear program. But they met resistance from the agency, and the latest report offered no new evidence, beyond the standard measures of Irans progress in enrichment.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In a separate statement, agency officials denied  recent claims  of a rift inside the  organization over what to publish in this report. In a statement, Marc Vidricaire, an I.A.E.A. spokesman, denied that the agency was hiding any internal reports about the extent or nature of the Iranian program or that   staff members had clashed about the reports contents.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Needless to say, he said, such allegations have no basis in fact.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The slowdown in the enrichment of uranium   the key ingredient  that Iran would need to produce to fuel nuclear power plants, or nuclear weapons    was something of a surprise. For reasons the agency could not explain, Iran has reduced, at least for now, the number of centrifuges it is actively using for enrichment, to 4,592 from 4,920 noted in the agencys report in June.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The report, however, also disclosed that Iran had increased the number of centrifuges that were installed and ready to add to Irans capacity. It put the new total at more than 8,300     an increase of more than 1,100  since June.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Continuing to install large numbers of new centrifuges is significant since filling them with raw uranium is a relatively minor step, the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isis-online.org/&quot; title=&quot;Group Web site&quot;&gt;\n  Institute for Science and International Security\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , a private group in Washington,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isis-online.org/publications/iran/Analysis_IAEA_Report.pdf&quot; title=&quot;The analysis&quot;&gt;\n  said in an analysis\n &lt;/a&gt;\n of the  report.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Some American intelligence officials have suggested that Iran is trying to build up enough centrifuges so that it can break out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty at any moment and produce weapons-grade fuel. Other officials, however, say they doubt Iran would try  to produce weapons-grade material from any centrifuges that the inspectors already know about.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Friday, the atomic agency also reported that Iran, even with the work slowdown, had substantially increased its stocks of enriched uranium. In June, the total stood at 839 kilograms, or 1,850 pounds. Fridays report listed the enrichment of an additional 669 kilograms, bringing the  total to 1,508 kilograms, or 3,325 pounds.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Thats a little short of what you need to make two bombs if Tehran decided to further enrich the material, said Gary Milhollin, director of the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wisconsinproject.org/&quot; title=&quot;Group Web site&quot;&gt;\n  Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , a research organization in Washington that tracks Irans atomic progress.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Perhaps because of the renewed pressure on the agency, the  report laid out many allegations that Iran had pursued a military program for the development of nuclear arms, apparently displaying the evidence at the request of Western governments. While some of the conclusions appeared more sharply drawn than in the past, agency officials insisted that the report was simply restating information that it had already made public.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Its much longer and more explicit, a European diplomat familiar with the agencys work said of the reports weapons section. But its not new information.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n For instance, the report said  Iran had confirmed the existence of a letter related to an alleged secretive military program known as the Green Salt Project    an effort that the United States believes links Irans\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islamic_revolutionary_guard_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&quot;&gt;\n  Revolutionary Guards\n &lt;/a&gt;\n to the nuclear program    and had even given the agency a copy of the letter. Previously, Iran had claimed that most of the evidence about  the project was exaggerated or fabricated by Western intelligence agencies.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The existence of this original demonstrates a direct link between the relevant documentation and Iran, the report said. The agency needs to see further related correspondence and to have access to the individuals named in the letter.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The report said that such linkages and credible bits of corroborating evidence put the onus on Iran to prove the weapons allegations false.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Tehran, the report said, had repeatedly evaded the substance of the charges. The atomic agency, it added, has therefore requested Iran to provide more substantive responses and to give it  access to people, information and locations identified in the documents so the agency can confirm Irans assertion that these documents are false and fabricated.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<node id="n7257">\n<data key="x">0.885542168675</data>\n<data key="y">0.3</data>\n<data key="label">Amid Large Protests, Iran Leader Calls Holocaust a Lie</data>\n<data key="date">2009-09-18</data>\n<data key="dummy">0</data>\n<data key="text">&lt;p&gt;\n BEIRUT, Lebanon  Tens of thousands of green-clad protesters chanted and carried banners through the heart of Tehran and other Iranian cities on Friday, defying tear gas and truncheons as they turned large swaths of a government-organized anti-Israel march into the largest opposition rally in two months.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;articleInline&quot;

The protesters even  flouted the days official message, chanting No to Gaza and Lebanon, my life is for Iran. And when government men shouted death to Israel through loudspeakers, protesters derisively chanted death to Russia in response. Many opposition supporters are angry about Russias quick acceptance of Mr. Ahmadinejads electoral victory.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Opposition leaders\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mir_hussein_moussavi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mir Hussein Moussavi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mir Hussein Moussavi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n ,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/mehdi_karroubi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mehdi Karroubi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mehdi Karroubi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , and Muhammad Khatami joined the crowds in Tehran, drawing appreciative cheers and chants of support. Later, Basij militia members tried to attack Mr. Khatami and Mr. Karroubi, but defenders fought them back, opposition Web sites reported.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The government had largely halted street protests in July, with a harsh government crackdown that left dozens of marchers dead and thousands in jail. But the authorities have been unable to silence the oppositions leaders, who have kept up their criticism of the election and the governments violent response. The opposition leaders raised tensions when they leveled accusations that some protesters were tortured and raped in prison. The rape accusations have been especially embarrassing for the government, which has denied them while acknowledging that some prisoners were tortured.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There were reports of similar demonstrations and clashes in other cities Friday, including Isfahan, Tabriz, Yazd, and Shiraz, where protesters skirmished with Basij militia men, and freed a group of fellow protesters who were being arrested, opposition Web sites reported.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In the capital, police and huge crowds of government supporters blocked most protesters from approaching Mr. Ahmadinejad as he arrived in a bullet-proof car at Tehran University to deliver a speech before the formal Friday prayers sermon. But as he began his remarks, chants of Resign! Resign! could be heard, according to witnesses cited on opposition Web sites.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Ahmadinejad said confrontation with Israel was a national and religious duty and that the Holocaust was a lie used as a pretext for the countrys creation in 1948. Although he has called the Holocaust a myth in the past, provoking angry reactions in the West, he does not appear to have used the word lie in connection with it before.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In Washington, the White House responded sharply to the remarks about the Holocaust from the Iranian leader. The presidents press secretary,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/robert_gibbs/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Robert Gibbs.&quot;&gt;\n  Robert Gibbs\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , said that by denying that the Holocaust took place was ignorant, hateful and would isolate Iran further from the world.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Obviously, we condemn what he said, Mr. Gibbs told reporters.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The speech came a day after\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Barack Obama.&quot;&gt;\n  President Obama\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , in a major national security reversal, scuttled his predecessors missile-shield plan to focus instead on protecting Israel and Europe against short and medium-range Iranian missiles.

Rice\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , said Friday that President Obama would not meet with Mr. Ahmadinejad next week when world leaders meet in New York City for the U.N. General Assembly meeting.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n I dont think there is much likelihood that there will be an interaction, Ms. Rice said. There is no obvious venue where that would occur.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Irans government has canceled a number of public gatherings over the past month, apparently fearing a renewal of the vast rallies that took place in the weeks after the election. As Jerusalem Day approached, a number of conservative figures, including Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , warned that the day should not become an occasion for domestic discontent. On Thursday, the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islamic_revolutionary_guard_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&quot;&gt;\n  Revolutionary Guard\n &lt;/a&gt;\n issued an especially fierce statement, declaring that all protesters would be treated as Israeli spies.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But  the government appears to have treated the widespread protests with relative leniency. Although tear gas was fired at some crowds in central Tehran  it was not clear by whom  there was no renewal of the fierce crackdown that took place in June and July, when dozens of people were killed and thousands jailed.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Although the marchers celebrating Jerusalem Day generally outnumbered the protesters, there were parts of the city where the opposite was true. Often, the protesters slyly distorted the traditional rallying cries of the pro-government crowds. When the marchers chanted The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader, protesters countered with The blood in our veins is a gift to our nation.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n At one point thousands of protesters chanting death to the dictator as they walked down Valiasr Street, the broad avenue that runs across much of Tehran, collided with an equally large crowd of pro-government marchers chanting slogans against Israel, the United States, and Britain.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n A tense standoff ensued. Police officers standing nearby refused to take sides, and in some cases even stepped in to break up fights. Finally, several trucks full of government supporters arrived, and the protesters began withdrawing in the direction from which they had come.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Iranian state television ignored the protests, showing thousands of marchers clad in checked Palestinian-style scarves, carrying posters of\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/hassan_nasrallah/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Hassan Nasrallah.&quot;&gt;\n  Hassan Nasrallah\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , the leader of the Lebanese militant group\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/hezbollah/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Hezbollah&quot;&gt;\n  Hezbollah\n &lt;/a&gt;\n . Jerusalem Day, held on the last Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan, is an important occasion for the government, which uses its support for Palestinian militants and the Lebanese Hezbollah to burnish its street support in an Arab world that is largely hostile to Iran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Toronto and Jeff Zeleny from Washington.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_author_id&gt;\n&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<node id="n7608">\n<data key="x">0.983935742972</data>\n<data key="y">0.4</data>\n<data key="label">As U.S. Plots Iran Strategy, Envoys Visit Hints at a Thaw</data>\n<data key="date">2009-10-01</data>\n<data key="dummy">0</data>\n<data key="text">&lt;p&gt;\n WASHINGTON  As the United States and\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More news and information about Iran.&quot;&gt;\n  Iran\n &lt;/a&gt;\n prepared for critical talks over Tehrans nuclear program, the Iranian foreign minister arrived quietly  in Washington on Wednesday to visit the unofficial embassy here, the first visit to the capital by an Iranian of that rank in a decade.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;articleInline&quot; class=&quot;inlineLeft&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;inlineBox&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;#secondParagraph&quot; class=&quot;jumpLink&quot;&gt;\n   Skip to next paragraph\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;enlargeThis&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:pop_me_up2(`http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2009/10/01/world/01nuke_CA0.inline.2.ready.html`, `01nuke_CA0_inline_2_ready`, `width=720,height=600,scrollbars=yes,toolbars=no,resizable=yes`)&quot;&gt;\n     Enlarge This Image\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:pop_me_up2(`http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2009/10/01/world/01nuke_CA0.inline.2.ready.html`, `01nuke_CA0_inline_2_ready`, `width=720,height=600,scrollbars=yes,toolbars=no,resizable=yes`)&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;img src=&quot;http://graphics7.nytimes.com/images/2009/10/01/world/01diplo.inline.1.190.jpg&quot; width=&quot;190&quot; height=&quot;124&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;\n   &lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;\n    Caren Firouz/Reuters\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;\n    Irans top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, said in Tehran that he was heading for talks in Geneva with a positive approach.\n   &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div id=&quot;sidebarArticles&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;h4&gt;\n    Related\n   &lt;/h4&gt;\n   &lt;h2&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/world/middleeast/01arabs.html?ref=middleeast&quot;&gt;\n     Possibility of a Nuclear-Armed Iran Alarms Arabs\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n    (October 1, 2009)\n   &lt;/h2&gt;\n   &lt;h2&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/world/middleeast/01diplo.html?ref=middleeast&quot;&gt;\n     Iranian Statement May Offer Window Into Nuclear Efforts\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n    (October 1, 2009)\n   &lt;/h2&gt;\n   &lt;h2&gt;\n    Times Topics:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/nuclear_program/index.html&quot;&gt;\n     Iran`s Nuclear Program\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n    |\n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html&quot;&gt;\n     Iran\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;img src=&quot;http://graphics7.nytimes.com/images/2009/10/01/world/01diplo.inline.2.190.jpg&quot; width=&quot;190&quot; height=&quot;131&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;\n    Vyacheslav Oseledko/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;\n    William J.

The last time an Iranian foreign minister was permitted to make such a visit was in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n It is an unusual coincidence; whether its a happy coincidence, well see tomorrow, said Philip J. Crowley, a State Department spokesman. It doesnt make the serious issues we confront any easier, but if its taken as a small gesture and contributes in some way, that will be terrific.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n With tensions over Irans nuclear ambitions on the rise, diplomats are to meet in Geneva Thursday in a secluded, 18th-century villa. The United States and five other countries were preparing to press Iran for practical, tangible steps to show its willingness to negotiate, a senior American official said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Among those would be full and unfettered access for inspectors to\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/world/middleeast/26nuke.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article&quot;&gt;\n  Irans uranium enrichment plant near the holy city of Qum\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , which the United States and its allies made public in an announcement last Friday.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n What we need to see now are not just words but actions, said a senior official, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to speak publicly before the meeting. That needs to be the beginning of what the Iranians are required to do  to come clean about their entire nuclear program.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The United States, which will be joined at the table by Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, is likely to offer Iran a repackaged version of something it has offered before: an agreement to hold off on\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/world/middleeast/28iran.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article&quot;&gt;\n  new sanctions\n &lt;/a&gt;\n if the Iranians agree to freeze their enrichment of uranium.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The proposal did not interest the Iranians before. But officials plan to try again, hoping that a new American administration, the pressure from disclosure of the nuclear enrichment complex, and internal divisions from Irans chaotic elections will make it more acceptable, American and European officials said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The point is to try to make it impossible for them to say no, a European diplomat said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n France or Russia, officials said, is likely to put another familiar inducement on the table: a plan to supply Iran with nuclear fuel, which it could use to operate its nuclear reactors under international monitoring.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Such an agreement, which would be policed by the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_atomic_energy_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about International Atomic Energy Agency&quot;&gt;\n  International Atomic Energy Agency\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , would give Iran a guaranteed source of enriched uranium for civilian energy needs but remove the fear that Iran would enrich uranium to the weapons-grade level needed for a nuclear bomb.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n For its part, officials and experts said, Iran is likely to turn up with a narrow agenda on its nuclear program, but a host of other issues, including overhauling the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the United Nations.&quot;&gt;\n  United Nations\n &lt;/a&gt;\n ; giving greater voice to non-Western countries; and universal nuclear disarmament. It laid these out in\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/world/middleeast/12nuke.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article&quot;&gt;\n  a five-page proposal last month\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , which was met with derision by Obama administration officials.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Iran is also likely to argue that it was not legally obliged to disclose its second enrichment plant, the one whose existence was made public last week. That contention will hinge on its safeguards agreement with the atomic agency, which originally said Iran was not required to disclose the plant until 180 days before it put fuel into it.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The agreement was later modified to require Irans disclosure as soon as it decided to build the complex. Iranian officials contend that Parliament never ratified the modification  an argument that the atomic energy agencys director general,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/mohamed_elbaradei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mohamed Elbaradei.&quot;&gt;\n  Mohamed ElBaradei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , has rejected.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n They have been on the wrong side of the law, said Dr. ElBaradei, who is normally circumspect.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In Tehran on Wednesday, President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n said Iran would be willing to buy enriched uranium from whomever will sell it to us  suggesting a possible willingness to compromise on the issue of enrichment. A senior American official said the international community would consider such a proposal, saying it wanted tangible steps in its negotiations with Iran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The United States will be represented by the under secretary of state for political affairs,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/105574.htm&quot; title=&quot;State Department biography.&quot;&gt;\n  William J.

His presence was considered a gesture, but he had instructions not to negotiate and he said little.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Thursday, Mr. Burns will be a full participant, officials said, and they strongly suggested that the talks could include a one-on-one meeting on the sidelines between Mr. Burns and Mr. Jalili.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Jalili said that he was heading for the talks with a positive approach, while Irans atomic energy chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said Iran was ready to discuss concerns about its new enrichment plant.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n He said that Iran would soon offer a timetable for inspection of the Qum complex and that Iran would try to resolve the issue both politically and technically by engaging with the six countries in Geneva and the atomic energy agency. But Iran would continue to insist on its right to enrich uranium, he said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We will not discuss about our rights to enrich uranium, he said Tuesday in Tehran. But we are ready to discuss about nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In Washington, diplomats buzzed about Mr. Mottakis visit. He spent Wednesday afternoon in the interest section, a nondescript office block near Georgetown. Outside were Middle East TV crews, diplomatic security officers in black S.U.V.s, and two federal agents wearing desert camouflage and armed with M-16s. A worker denied a reporters request for entry.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Some Iran experts said the visit was a coup for Mr. Ahmadinejads government. But they worried that the United States could send the wrong message to the Iranian people. In Irans conspiratorial political culture, this will be seen by many people as a U.S. effort to cut a deal with the regime at their expense, said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carnegieendowment.org/&quot; title=&quot;Web site of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&quot;&gt;\n  the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\n &lt;/a&gt;\n .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Steven Erlanger from Geneva.

Trying to strike a firm tone, Mr. Obama said that he also expected Iran to allow international weapons inspectors into its nuclear facility at Qom within two weeks.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Were not interested in talking for the sake of talking, Mr. Obama said in a remarks to reporters in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room.

Mr. Wood said he had no other details on the private meeting.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Burns, a career diplomat with a long history in the Middle East, attended a similar meeting with Iran in July 2008 during the Bush administration, though he had instructions not to negotiate.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Washington had hoped to begin bilateral talks with Iran on a range of issues, among them trade and Tehrans support for\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/palestinians/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Palestinians.&quot;&gt;\n  Palestinian\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , Lebanese and Iraqi insurgent and terrorist groups, including\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/hezbollah/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Hezbollah&quot;&gt;\n  Hezbollah\n &lt;/a&gt;\n and\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islamic_jihad/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Islamic Jihad&quot;&gt;\n  Islamic Jihad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But after new disclosures of a hidden Iranian enrichment facility dug deep into a guarded mountain near the holy city of Qum, the focus shifted to persuading Iran to permit serious nuclear inspections and suspend its nuclear enrichment program.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Solana said Iran had also agreed to export its own low-enriched uranium from one specific facility, the Russian-built plant at Natanz, for further enrichment to make isotopes for medical purposes. Mr. Solana portrayed that agreement as progress toward Iran agreeing to limit its own enrichment activities.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Iran maintains that all of its uranium enrichment is for peaceful purposes, mostly for energy production.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Obama said Irans signal that it would be willing to transfer low enriched uranium to a third party would be a first step.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Wednesday, Mr. Mottaki, the foreign minister, visited his countrys unofficial embassy in Washington, the first trip to the capital by an Iranian of that rank in a decade.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The visit by Mr. Mottaki, who had been at the United Nations, was approved by the White House, and it was seen as an effort to help thaw the atmosphere as the Obama administration puts its policy of engagement with Iran to the test. Mr. Mottaki, however, said Thursday that he had only gone to ensure that the Iranian diaspora in America were being well looked after.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Iran maintains a diplomatic outpost in the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. The last time an Iranian foreign minister was permitted to make such a visit was in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n It is an unusual coincidence; whether its a happy coincidence, well see, said Philip J. Crowley, a State Department spokesman. It doesnt make the serious issues we confront any easier, but if its taken as a small gesture and contributes in some way, that will be terrific.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Many diplomats and analysts believe that the Qum facility is only one of a series of hidden installations that Iran has constructed alongside its public ones for what is considered to be a military program. Iran insists its program is purely peaceful and insists on its rights to enrich, but has regularly lied to the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency about its facilities.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The United States was thought to be likely to offer Iran a repackaged version of something it has offered before: an agreement to hold off on new sanctions if the Iranians agree to freeze their enrichment of uranium, so that serious negotiations can take place. The West remains wary of talking while Iran continues enrichment, fearing a negotiation without end or result.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The proposal had not interest the Iranians before. But officials planned to try again, hoping that a new American administration, the pressure from disclosure of the nuclear enrichment complex and internal divisions from Irans chaotic elections and the ensuing crackdown on demonstrators will make it more acceptable, American and European officials said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But some American officials believed that the turmoil in Iran would make its government less willing to compromise and appear weak.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   Steven Erlanger reported from Geneva and Mark Landler from Washington.

In other words, is the Iranian government serious this time?\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The clearest risk is that the Iranians may play for time, as they have often been accused of doing in the past, making promises and encouraging more meetings, while waiting for political currents to change or the closed ranks among the Western allies to break.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n After Tehran agreed to send most of its openly declared enriched uranium outside Iran to be turned into fuel, Obama administration officials were clearly walking a fine line on Thursday between celebrating what could be\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/world/middleeast/02nuke.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article&quot;&gt;\n  a possible breakthrough in international efforts\n &lt;/a&gt;\n to rein in Irans nuclear ambitions and sounding appropriately skeptical that the administration was not going to be played by Tehran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Taking the step of transferring its low-enriched uranium to a third country would be a step towards building confidence that Irans program is in fact peaceful,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-the-meeting-of-the-P5-plus-1-regarding-Iran/&quot; title=&quot;Transcript of Mr. Obamas remarks&quot;&gt;\n  Mr. Obama said Thursday\n &lt;/a&gt;\n . But, perhaps aware of the countrys history of appearing to make concessions and then backing off, he quickly added: Were not interested in talking for the sake of talking. If Iran does not take steps in the near future to live up to its obligations, then the United States will not continue to negotiate indefinitely, and we are prepared to move towards increased pressure.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n It was, in many ways, the exact opposite of what a White House usually does after major international talks. Instead of painting lukewarm concessions as major breakthroughs and going on and on about warm substantive meetings, officials were treating a potentially major breakthrough as if it were a suspicious package.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n If Iran has really agreed to send most of its openly declared enriched uranium out of the country to be turned into fuel, that is a significant concession, experts said, and much more than the Bush administration ever got over the years of its nonengagement dance with Iran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n This is actually quite important if it takes place, said Ray Takeyh, a former Iran adviser to the Obama administration. If you establish an arrangement whereby Irans fuel is exported abroad, then that relieves some degree of your proliferation concern.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n For the administration, though, the problem is that no one is certain that the Iranian government will actually do what Western officials say that it has now agreed to do. In fact, on Friday, less than 24 hours after the talks in Geneva broke up, Iranian officials did not sound as if they thought they had promised anything.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n No, no! Mehdi Saffare, Irans ambassador to Britain and a member of the Iranian delegation to the negotiations, said, according to the Associated Press. He said that the idea of sending Irans enriched uranium out of the county had not been discussed yet.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n This is not the first time that Western officials have left discussions with their Iranian counterparts thinking they had a deal, only to see it melt away. In 2007, European diplomats said they thought they had wrung a concession from Iran on the same issue, enriching uranium outside the country for use in Iranian reactors, only to have Irans supreme religious leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , reject the idea as an infringement of Irans sovereignty.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Thats the big if, isnt it? a senior Obama administration official said. Will they do it? No one wants to do a premature victory lap. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There are some circumstances that would seem to favor Mr. Obama, analysts said. Fresh from the turmoil in Iran after the disputed presidential election in June that secured a second term for the hard-line president,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , the Iranian government is fighting on three fronts, said Abbas Milani, director of\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://iranian-studies.stanford.edu/&quot; title=&quot;The programs Web site&quot;&gt;\n  the Iranian studies program at Stanford University\n &lt;/a&gt;\n . Theyre fighting with the people of Iran, theyre fighting within themselves, and theyre fighting with the international community. Theyve just decided that they cant fight a three-front war, so theyre trying to lower the tension on the fight with the international community, at least.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In recent weeks, Mr. Obama has also secured  at least for now\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/world/24prexy.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article&quot;&gt;\n  some support from Russia\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , which emerged after Mr. Obama\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/europe/18shield.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article&quot;&gt;\n  decided to replace the missile defense program\n &lt;/a&gt;\n in Eastern Europe favored by President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about George W.

Medvedev\n &lt;/a&gt;\n of Russia signaled for the first time that Russia would be amenable to longstanding American requests to toughen sanctions against Iran if the nuclear talks failed.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Still, the administrations caution is warranted, said Mr. Takeyh, the former adviser on Iran, especially since some Iranian officials in Tehran denied on Friday that they had assured the United States and other major powers in Geneva that they would open a recently disclosed uranium enrichment plant near Qum to international inspectors within two weeks.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n This was in addition to the dispute over whether Iran had agreed to send much of its low-enriched uranium, known in the field as L.E.U., to be turned into fuel in other counties.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n You dont want to go out and celebrate an achievement and then watch the Iranians backtrack, Mr. Takeyh said.

The more pertinent point, Iran experts and regional analysts say, is that Iran finally may be ready to make a deal.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The analysts cite a confluence of factors, from Irans internal political crisis to the change in leadership in Washington, and one overriding point: Irans leadership may have achieved much of what it set out to accomplish when it stepped up its clandestine nuclear program in 1999.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In contentious, high-stakes negotiations, deals are possible when both sides have a chance to declare victory, and that point may have been reached.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n If the Iranian endgame is to keep enrichment, and if the United States endgame is to make sure there are no nuclear weapons in Iran, then it can be a win-win, said Trita Parsi, author of a book on Iran and president of the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niacouncil.org/&quot; title=&quot;Groups Web site.&quot;&gt;\n  National Iranian American Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , an independent advocacy group in Washington. Those who have been criticizing the administration for compromising or giving Iran a concession, they are wrong. It is not a concession to adjust to an unchanging reality.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n For Iran, this is not exactly about compromising  which it has shown little appetite for  as much as cooperating. For the West, it is not about winning concessions but about developing verifiable assurances that Iran is not producing weapons.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n I think the Iranians are simply in no mood to accept any serious limits on the expansion of their program, said Flynt Leverett, director of the Iran Project at the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newamerica.net/&quot; title=&quot;Foundations Web site.&quot;&gt;\n  New America Foundation\n &lt;/a&gt;\n . From their point of view, they already suspended enrichment for almost two years, from 2003 to 2005, and from their perspective, they got nothing for that and theyre not going to do that again.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But Mr. Leverett said Iran sees that by expanding, theyve gotten the attention of the international community and they have cards to play.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n And that may have been Irans primary goal from the start.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There are many analysts inside and outside Iran who say that Tehrans objective has been to master  or at least appear to master  the process of preparing nuclear fuel, fashioning a warhead and providing the means to deliver that warhead, but not actually to build a weapon.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n This is in line with a\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/world/middleeast/04nuke.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article on the report&quot;&gt;\n  recent report\n &lt;/a&gt;\n from the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iaea.org/&quot; title=&quot;Agencys Web site.&quot;&gt;\n  International Atomic Energy Agency\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , which found that Iran had acquired sufficient information to be able to design and produce a workable nuclear weapon but did not present evidence that it was trying to produce one. Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , issued a fatwa, or religious edict, in 2005\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/2005/infcirc657.pdf&quot; title=&quot;I.A.E.A. document; fatwa is mentioned on Page 121 (PDF).&quot;&gt;\n  banning the production of nuclear weapons\n &lt;/a&gt;\n .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Tehran knows that actually deploying a weapon could undermine its regional strength by driving smaller oil-rich neighbors to seek their own nuclear umbrella, presumably from the United States. Rather, experts say, Irans intention all along was to strengthen its hand in dealing with the West, to achieve legitimacy, security and recognition of its leadership in the region. Irans meeting with the United States and Western powers in Geneva brought it within reach of those goals.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The United States negotiated directly with Iran and, perhaps more important, Iran walked away with an implicit acceptance of its right to continue enrichment on its own soil, which it considers a matter of national sovereignty.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n They are already where they wanted to be, said Abbas Milani, head of Iranian studies at Stanford, even before the Geneva meeting. They are virtually a nuclear state; the issue of national pride is resolved.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Writing in his blog,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.juancole.com/2009/10/iran-and-nuclear-latency.html&quot; title=&quot;Link to the blog.&quot;&gt;\n  Informed Comment\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , Juan Cole, an expert on Iran and the contemporary Middle East, described Tehrans goal as nuclear latency, which he said explained why the leadership had insisted it was not trying to build weapons while also driving hard to master construction of a bomb.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Nuclear latency has all the advantages of actual possession of a bomb without any of the unpleasant consequences, of the sort North Korea is suffering, Mr. Cole wrote.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There is other evidence that this was Irans goal from the start.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Hassan Rowhani, a cleric who served for years as Irans chief nuclear negotiator and the head of its Supreme\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_security_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about National Security Council, U.S.&quot;&gt;\n  National Security Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , published in 2005 a\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications1/meb/MEB5.pdf&quot; title=&quot;An academic article on the speech (PDF).&quot;&gt;\n  private speech\n &lt;/a&gt;\n he gave a year earlier.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n While there have been tactical disagreements over the years between hard-liners and pragmatists like Mr. Rowhani, the speech indicated that there was no dispute over the end goal.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The world did not want Pakistan to have an atomic bomb or Brazil to have the fuel cycle, but Pakistan built its bomb and Brazil has its fuel cycle, and the world started to work with them, he said. Our problem is that we have not achieved either one, but we are standing at the threshold. As for building the atomic bomb, we never wanted to move in that direction and we have not yet completely developed our fuel cycle capability.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n When Iran met with Western powers in Geneva, it offered what appeared to be a compromise. It said that it would allow inspectors into a recently disclosed enrichment facility near the holy city of Qum and it agreed to send its modestly enriched fuel to Russia to be processed further. Tehran also agreed to keep talking, which seemed to contradict President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n s insistence that Iran would deal only with the I.A.E.A. about its nuclear program.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But back at home, the hard-liners declared success.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Prior to the talks, they used to speak of suspension and sanctions against Iran, but after the talks there has not been any word of suspension or sanctions. Rather, Irans package of proposals was the focus, said Ayatollah Ahmed Khatami, a conservative cleric,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.farsnews.net/newstext.php?nn=8807170905&quot; title=&quot;Fars news agency report on the sermon.&quot;&gt;\n  during a Friday Prayer sermon at Tehran University\n &lt;/a&gt;\n last week.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Even if the West manages to extract a deal from Iran that both sides can accept, and even if it can verify implementation, there are other, serious considerations, experts said. Some analysts said that there was concern the West could undermine whatever fragment of a reform movement survived in Iran after the disputed June presidential election and government crackdown.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There is also the chance that a latent nuclear program could become active, which is why some, like Mr. Parsi of the National Iranian American Council, argue that monitoring and inspections  more than trying to end enrichment  should become the Wests primary demands.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There is also the danger that making a deal now will send the message that the way to get what you want is to emulate North Korea and act belligerently. But Mr. Parsi said that might also provide Washington policy makers with a valuable lesson.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Sometimes, he said, a compromise is an adjustment to reality.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting from Cairo.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_author_id&gt;\n&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<node id="n8160">\n<data key="x">1.37751004016</data>\n<data key="y">0.1</data>\n<data key="label">Iran Agrees to Draft of Deal on Exporting Nuclear Fuel</data>\n<data key="date">2009-10-21</data>\n<data key="dummy">0</data>\n<data key="text">&lt;p&gt;\n VIENNA Iranian negotiators have agreed to a draft of a deal to ship about three-quarters of the countrys  stockpile of nuclear fuel to Russia for enrichment, the head of the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_atomic_energy_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about International Atomic Energy Agency&quot;&gt;\n  International Atomic Energy Agency\n &lt;/a&gt;\n said Wednesday.

It would also buy time for Mr. Obama to attempt to negotiate a far larger and more difficult agreement to end Irans production of new nuclear material.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n While the talks here were characterized as technical discussions to turn a general agreement made three weeks ago at a meeting in Geneva into a specific contract, all sides understood the enormous stakes. The United States is seeking to convince Israel that negotiations have greatly reduced the risk of nuclear breakout  Irans ability to throw out international inspectors and rapidly turn its reactor fuel into bomb fuel.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Theres a part of this thats about getting our diplomacy with Iran started, and a part thats about  convincing the Israelis that theres no reason to drop hints that they are going to reach for a military solution, one senior administration official said from Washington.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The Friday deadline for Iran to respond opens up what promises to be a major test for Irans leadership, one that is intended to explore the proposition of whether Iran really wants to negotiate its way out of this problem, in the words of one White House official.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We want it to make it clear weve made bona-fide offers to the Iranians, the official said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Others in the White House argue that the Bush administration, by refusing to talk to Iran, never forced the Iranian leadership to make a choice. If Iran rejects the accord, administration officials believe, that could make it easier to get Security Council approval for harsher financial sanctions, a step that has been steadfastly resisted so far by Russia and China.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The same theory applies to Irans behavior on Sunday, when a team of I.A.E.A. inspectors arrives for a first look at a newly-revealed nuclear enrichment facility buried deep inside a mountain near the holy city of Qum. Inspectors have already asked Iran for far more than just a visit. They say they want engineering drawings, permission to interview scientists and others involved in planning the long-hidden nuclear site and explanations about whether there are other hidden facilities to feed the Qum plant with nuclear material. So far the Iranians have not responded.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Even if approved, the deal would represent only one small step toward resolving the Iranian nuclear program that has become one of the most complex foreign policy challenges facing Mr. Obama and the Middle East. Because Iran continues to produce nuclear fuel at a rapid clip, this accord would be only a temporary fix, though a symbolically important one.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n American officials, including the head of the negotiating delegation here, Daniel Poneman, dodged reporters today and declined to discuss the contents of the agreement drafted by the director general of the nuclear agency,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/mohamed_elbaradei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mohamed Elbaradei.&quot;&gt;\n  Mohamed ElBaradei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n . Mr. ElBaradei set a deadline of Friday for all sides to give, I hope, affirmative action to the agreement, which he said was a balanced agreement.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. ElBaradei, who is leaving his post at the end of next month,  said he hoped that leaders in the West and in Tehran would see the big picture and approve the agreement. But his voice was tinged with doubt.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n While the amount of uranium that would be exported is significant, a critical part of the agreement is the timing of the shipments.  Mr. Poneman, the deputy secretary of energy, and other American officials have refused to discuss that detail or any others, leaving the White House open to charges that the accord would truly prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear breakout capability.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We are not going to get into the details, said Michael Hammer, a spokesman for the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_security_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about National Security Council, U.S.&quot;&gt;\n  National Security Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Iran approached the atomic agency last summer with an urgent appeal for help in refueling its Tehran Research Reactor, which makes medical isotopes. At the Geneva meeting a senior White House adviser to Mr. Obama, Gary Samore, proposed that Iran use the fuel it has produced itself in recent years  in violation of three Security Council resolutions  to feed the reactor, sending it to Russia to be enriched to 19.75 percent, which the reactor requires.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;pageLinks&quot;&gt;\n &lt;ul id=&quot;pageNumbers&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n   1\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n   &lt;a onclick=&quot;s_code_linktrack(`Article-MultiPagePageNum2`);&quot; title=&quot;Page 2&quot; href=&quot;/2009/10/22/world/middleeast/22nuke.html?pagewanted=2&quot; title=&quot;Next Page&quot; href=\'&quot;/2009/10/22/world/middleeast/22nuke.html?pagewanted=2\'&gt;\n   &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<node id="n8279">\n<data key="x">1.47590361446</data>\n<data key="y">0.4</data>\n<data key="label">News Analysis: Both Iran and West Fear a Trap on Deal</data>\n<data key="date">2009-10-26</data>\n<data key="dummy">0</data>\n<data key="text">&lt;p&gt;\n WASHINGTON  Just before international inspectors on Sunday were guided for the first time into an Iranian nuclear enrichment plant\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/world/middleeast/26nuke.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article&quot;&gt;\n  whose existence was a state secret until recently\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , the speaker of\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More news and information about Iran.&quot;&gt;\n  Iran\n &lt;/a&gt;\n s Parliament warned his countrymen to beware of American efforts to cheat Iran out of the nuclear fuel that has become the countrys currency in reasserting its power.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;articleInline&quot; class=&quot;inlineLeft&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;leftNavTabs&quot;&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;inlineBox&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;#secondParagraph&quot; class=&quot;jumpLink&quot;&gt;\n   Skip to next paragraph\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;div id=&quot;sidebarArticles&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;h4&gt;\n    Related\n   &lt;/h4&gt;\n   &lt;h2&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/10/25/world/AP-ML-Iran-Nuclear.html?ref=middleeast&quot;&gt;\n     U.N.

They are acutely aware of the fact that the clock is ticking: While talks continue, Iran is steadily enriching more uranium, the fuel it would need if it ever decided to sprint for the bomb, much as Israel and India did 30 years ago, followed by Pakistan and North Korea.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n That struggle  pitting Irans fears of falling for a Western conspiracy to neutralize its strategic reserve against the Wests fears of being lured into an Iranian plot to buy time for a secret nuclear bomb program  lies at the heart of the complex set of moves and countermoves now being played out around the globe.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n It will probably be several weeks before the results of the inspection of the newly revealed Qum nuclear enrichment plant are known. Iran has said it will give a definitive answer before then about whether it will go along with\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/world/middleeast/02nuke.html&quot; title=&quot;Times article&quot;&gt;\n  a deal to turn over much of its current stockpile of enriched uranium to Russia\n &lt;/a&gt;\n for further processing, so that it can be returned to Iran for use in a reactor that makes medical isotopes.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n For days now, Irans leadership has been fighting over whether to take that deal, with political opponents of President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n all but declaring that he is being duped.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Among them is the speaker of Parliament,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/ali_larijani/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Larijani.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Larijani\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , who is Irans former nuclear negotiator. On Saturday, he was widely quoted in the Iranian press as saying that the West was trying to deceive Iran and might never return its enriched uranium. He argued that other nations were obliged under the rules of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to sell Iran new fuel. Mr. Obama tried to head off that possibility this weekend with calls to allies and to President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/dmitri_a_medvedev/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Dmitri A. Medvedev.&quot;&gt;\n  Dmitri A. Medvedev\n &lt;/a&gt;\n of Russia, urging them to press Iran to give up its stockpile.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The rare public argument under way in Iran about how to deal with the demands suggests that Mr. Obama has already achieved one of the major objectives of his engagement strategy: to force out into the open the splits in the Iranian leadership. As R. Nicholas Burns, the lead State Department strategist on Iran during the Bush administration, told Congress over the summer, President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about George W. Bush.&quot;&gt;\n  George W. Bush\n &lt;/a&gt;\n s refusal to negotiate with Iran for eight years meant that the United States never forced the countrys ruling mullahs to justify their actions to their own people, who have suffered from sanctions and may be less interested in the nuclear program than in better relations with the world.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n I think that for the first time, the Iranians are really on the defensive, Mr. Burns said recently.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Irans leaders may find themselves playing a more complex game of defense in the coming weeks. They appear to have been forced into revealing the existence of the Qum enrichment complex after learning that Western intelligence agencies had discovered it.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Now, they have to contain the damage. In interviews last week in Vienna, the headquarters of the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_atomic_energy_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about International Atomic Energy Agency&quot;&gt;\n  International Atomic Energy Agency\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , diplomats preparing for the inspection of the site near the holy city of Qum made it clear that the West would insist on far more than just visits to the heavily bunkered plant, hard up against a base for the Iranian\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islamic_revolutionary_guard_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&quot;&gt;\n  Revolutionary Guards\n &lt;/a&gt;\n Corps. The inspectors view Qum as an outer layer of a ball of string  and they plan on pulling at the strands to discover other secret sites, if there are any.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n How many times have the Iranians told us, Weve revealed everything, only to come back and admit that there is much, much more? a senior European diplomat, who has been deeply involved in developing the strategy to confront Tehran, said last week.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The Iranians contend that they have been under no legal obligation to report the construction of the enrichment plant until it was ready to operate, an argument that the atomic energy agency dismisses as a self-interested misreading of the rules. That is just one example of Irans central argument, that it is abiding by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, but that it has often been driven to covert efforts because the West is plotting to deprive the country of its right to develop its own nuclear technology.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But White House officials are extremely aware of their own political and practical vulnerabilities in dealing with Iran. The Iranian nuclear program flowered in recent years. The country possessed only minute amounts of nuclear fuel when the United States invaded Iraq in March 2003, and by the time the Bush administration left office, it had the fuel for roughly one weapon. There is a dispute among the allies over whether it halted or continued its efforts to design a nuclear weapon.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But few in the White House doubt how the narrative will be written if the Iranians actually gain a weapons ability on Mr. Obamas watch. That is why Secretary of State\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/hillary_rodham_clinton/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Hillary Rodham Clinton.&quot;&gt;\n  Hillary Rodham Clinton\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , who as a presidential candidate dismissed Mr. Obamas engagement policy with Iran as nave, last week warned anew that the process of engagement cannot be open-ended. The strategy behind the negotiations that unfolded in Vienna last week was pretty straightforward. If Iran was truly interested in peaceful uses for its nuclear fuel, it should accept the Wests help in using its own stockpile to fuel the reactor in Tehran that makes medical isotopes. If they rejected the deal, it should be easier, in theory, to get Russia and China to join sanctions.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Many people at the negotiating table expect Iran to try to drag out the process. Yet even if Iran took the deal, it would only buy time; it would not solve the nuclear standoff. If 2,600 pounds of enriched uranium leaves the country, as the plan calls for, it would take Tehran roughly a year to replace it. That is not much time, but since American intelligence estimates say that Iran could produce a weapon between 2010 and 2015, even a years delay helps. The Iranians say time is on their side in this dispute, and as long as their government holds together in the face of rising protests, they may be right.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   Michael Slackman contributed reporting from Cairo, and Nazila Fathi from Toronto.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_author_id&gt;\n&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<node id="n8957">\n<data key="x">1.57429718876</data>\n<data key="y">0.1</data>\n<data key="label">As Iran Stalls on Nuclear Deal, New Sanctions Weighed</data>\n<data key="date">2009-11-20</data>\n<data key="dummy">0</data>\n<data key="text">&lt;p&gt;\n PARIS    Senior officials from Western powers discussed the possibility of new sanctions on\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More news and information about Iran.&quot;&gt;\n  Iran\n &lt;/a&gt;\n on Friday for flouting the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/security_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Security Council, U.N.&quot;&gt;\n  United Nations Security Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n s demands and expressed disappointment that Iran had not yet accepted a draft agreement to export most of its enriched uranium for nuclear fuel.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The officials met in Brussels to discuss where matters stand with Iran and the possibility of new sanctions should Iran continue to play for time.

Reuters reported that on Monday, the Iranian police surrounded Tehran University to prevent members of the opposition from demonstrating at the rally.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The authorities have ordered foreign news media not to cover the event and Internet service was reduced to a trickle on Saturday, so slow that it was impossible to open e-mails or any Web pages, a journalist in Tehran said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The measure appeared to be aimed at preventing information about the crackdown or the protest to get outside the country and also to deprive the opposition from its key means, the Internet and\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/facebook_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Facebook.&quot;&gt;\n  Facebook\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , to mobilize their supporters. Videos posted online have played a critical role in showing the world what has been happening inside Iran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The government has also arrested dozens of student leaders in Tehran and across the country in the past weeks. However, students continued to say they would hold demonstrations at universities around the country on Monday. In Tehran, the nightly rooftop chants of Allahu akbar, meaning God is great, an opposition ritual since June, were louder than usual Sunday night.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The chants rocked Tehran, said the journalist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, out of fear for his safety. People will also go out tomorrow but only to stop the traffic. It wont be as large as previous protests.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n There are no plans for street demonstrations on Monday but students plan to hold demonstrations inside universities, which security forces are banned from entering.

They are asking us to forget about the election results as though people are concerned only about the elections, he said. How can we make them understand that this is not the issue? It is not about who the president is or is not; the issue is that they have sold out a great nation.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Moussavi has been issuing statements regularly since June. Despite threats of arrest, he remains free, but his movement is restricted, according to an ally outside the country.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n His comments were followed by criticism of the government by Akbar\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/ali_akbar_hashemi_rafsanjani/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.&quot;&gt;\n  Hashemi Rafsanjani\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , an influential politician who sided with the opposition but had been silent recently.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Constructive criticism is not tolerated in the country, Mr. Rafsanjani said at a meeting with students in the city of Mashad, according to the Web site\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mowjcamp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Web site&quot;&gt;\n  mowjcamp.com\n &lt;/a&gt;\n .

The clashes took place on campuses in cities across the country, as students and opposition members took advantage of National Student Day to vent their rage despite a lengthy and wide-ranging government effort to forestall them.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The violence continued Tuesday on the campus of Tehran University, where security forces were using tear gas and arresting students, according to reports and video clips relayed through\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/twitter/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Twitter.&quot;&gt;\n  Twitter\n &lt;/a&gt;\n and\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEiB_4yaTsE&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video&quot;&gt;\n  Internet postings\n &lt;/a&gt;\n . There were protests at large squares near the university as well, witnesses said. Irans official IRNA news agency reported that the clashes began after groups of pro-government students carrying pictures of Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , clashed with protesters on campus.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The new violence came as Irans chief prosecutor, Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejehi, warned of even harsher measures if the protests do not cease.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n So far, we have shown restraint, Mr. Mohseni-Ejehi said, according to Irans official IRNA news agency. Anyone who in any way endangers security must be dealt with.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mondays protests marked a striking escalation in direct attacks on the countrys theocratic foundation and not just on the June presidential elections, which the opposition has attacked as fraudulent. Protesters burned pictures of Ayatollah Khamenei, and even the father of the 1979 revolution, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ruhollah_khomeini/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ruhollah Khomeini&quot;&gt;\n  Ruhollah Khomeini\n &lt;/a&gt;\n . They held up  flags from which the Allah emblem, added after the revolution, had been removed.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The protests were timed to an official holiday commemorating the killing of three students by   Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavis forces in 1953. Students have  held a central role in the insurrections of Irans modern history.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Tuesday, the opposition leader\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mir_hussein_moussavi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mir Hussein Moussavi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mir Hussein Moussavi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n who was reportedly prevented from attending Mondays demonstrations  had a tense standoff with angry security men who had surrounded his office, according to opposition Web sites.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n As Mr. Moussavi was leaving his office in a car, dozens of men on motorbikes, some wearing masks, blocked his way and chanted angry slogans against him, the Gooya News Web site reported.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Against the advice of his security team, Mr. Moussavi got out of his car and angrily shouted at the men, You are on a mission  do your job, threaten me, beat me, kill me. Mr. Moussavis security detail then took him back inside the building.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Moussavi, a former prime minister and the leading challenger to President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n in the disputed June presidential election, spoke out strongly against the governments intimidation tactics on Sunday, warning that arresting students would be counterproductive.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Moussavi has walked a fine line in recent months, struggling to maintain his role as an insider who supports Irans Islamic system but who is fiercely opposed to Mr. Ahmadinejad and his hard-line policies.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But in recent months,  it has become unclear how much Mr. Moussavi speaks for the opposition, which includes many who appear to be taking a more radical approach and demanding an end to the theocracy. During Mondays demonstrations, there were fewer people with clothing or banners in the trademark bright-green color of Mr. Moussavis presidential campaign. And there were more chants aimed directly at Ayatollah Khamenei  a taboo that has increasingly eroded since the election. In addition to the now common chants of death to the dictator, some protesters chanted, Khamenei knows his time is up on Monday.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<node id="n9538">\n<data key="x">1.86947791165</data>\n<data key="y">0.8</data>\n<data key="label">Amnesty International Assails Irans Rights Record</data>\n<data key="date">2009-12-10</data>\n<data key="dummy">0</data>\n<data key="text">&lt;p&gt;\n BEIRUT, Lebanon  In the video, one of hundreds filmed during\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More news and information about Iran.&quot;&gt;\n  Iran\n &lt;/a&gt;\n s nationwide demonstrations on Monday, an enraged womans voice can be heard as an Iranian para-military truck\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoXnKS_CsIkThis is the Islamic republic! she shouts, gesturing at the truck.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That message has grown increasingly common in recent protests, as demonstrators have made clear that their target is not just Iranian president &amp;lt;a href=&quot;&gt;\n &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n That message has grown increasingly common in recent protests, as demonstrators have made clear that their target is not just Iranian president\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , or the disputed elections that returned him to power in June, but the entire foundation of Irans theocracy.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n During Mondays demonstrations, the civil tone of many earlier rallies was noticeably absent. There was no sign of opposition leader Mir-Hussein Moussavi  a moderate figure who supports reform within the system  and few were wearing the signature bright-green color of his campaign.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Instead, the protesters, most of them young people, took direct aim at Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , chanting Khamenei knows his time is up.

They have to at some point opt for regime survival or become the leaders of an opposition movement calling for more than reform.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Some in Iran have even speculated that Mr. Moussavi and Mr. Karroubi were uncomfortable with the most recent round of protests, which were timed to a holiday commemorating the killing of three students by the Shahs forces in 1953. In contrast to earlier protests, the opposition leaders did not organize the demonstrations, do not appear to have attended and have been silent since.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The aggressive tone of Mondays protests may partly reflect the fact that they took place on and around university campuses, where radical sentiment is more common. But students have long been central to social movements in Iran, where the population is now overwhelmingly young; as Mr. Moussavi himself pointed out last weekend, one in 20 Iranians is a student. And this weeks protests  which took place in at least a dozen cities and towns across Iran  were much broader than the ones that shook Iran in 1999, said Rasool Nafisi, an academic and Iran expert.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n A number of high-ranking figures in Iran had noted the oppositions radicalizing trend, even before the latest protests. Over the weekend,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/ali_akbar_hashemi_rafsanjani/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , the influential former president, warned in a speech that the young and the elite have been estranged from the regime, and criticized the government for using the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islamic_revolutionary_guard_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&quot;&gt;\n  Revolutionary Guards\n &lt;/a&gt;\n and the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/basij_militia/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Basij militia.&quot;&gt;\n  Basij\n &lt;/a&gt;\n militia against street protesters.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Rafsanjani, a founder of the Islamic republic who has provided crucial support for the opposition since the elections, added pointedly that there are some conservatives who think the peoples vote is just a decoration. He admonished this group, saying If they want us to rule, we will; if they dont, we will go.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Other leaders have also called for a greater spirit of compromise from the government. Among them is a prominent conservative cleric, Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi, who noted last week in remarks to Irans semi-official ISNA news service that a large number of people had voted against Mr. Ahmadinejad and that we should sit together and negotiate.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But the governments response to Mondays demonstrations was anything but conciliatory. Many witnesses said the police and Basij militia were more aggressive than they had been since the summer, beating protesters with chains and truncheons and arresting hundreds of them in cities across Iran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Since then, hard-liners have stepped up their warnings. Intelligence minister Heidar Moslehi lashed out at Mr. Rafsanjani and accused him of siding with those who oppose the Islamic system, in comments reported on Irans official IRNA news agency Thursday.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Shockingly, Rafsanjani expresses the same ideas that come in the statements of opposition leaders, Mr. Moslehi said, according to The Associated Press.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The intelligence minister also seemed to lay down the gauntlet to moderates, accusing them of joining the assault on Ayatollah Khamenei.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n A lot of forces that were expected to support the supreme leader instead went with those who rose against the supreme leader, he said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n One prominent conservative who has been critical of Mr. Ahmadinejad, Habibollah Asgaroladi, said the opposition had grown more anti-revolutionary, Iranian Web sites reported.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Many in the opposition have echoed those warnings, from the other side of the aisle.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The regime is on a path which threatens its own survival, declared the Iranian Writers Society, in a statement released Tuesday and posted on opposition Web sites.

Two were hanged last week.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In the interview, Mr. Moussavi said the executions were aimed at terrifying people into submission.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The majority of people believed in the beginning of the revolution that the roots of dictatorship and despotism were abolished, he said. I was one of them but now I dont have the same beliefs. You can still find the elements and roots that lead to dictatorship.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Moussavi served as a prime minister in the first eight years after the revolution. He and another opposition leader,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/mehdi_karroubi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mehdi Karroubi.&quot;&gt;\n  Mehdi Karroubi\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , ran against President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n in June. The government abruptly declared Mr. Ahmadinejad the winner by a lopsided margin even in areas that had voted heavily for the other candidates, leading to widespread accusations of fraud.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Those accusations led to widespread antigovernment protests, a brutal repression and the worst political crisis in Iran since the revolution.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Moussavi said that he did not believe the revolution had achieved its goals. People want justice and freedom today.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We have given up our hope in the judiciary, he said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Still, Mr. Moussavi tempered his remarks by saying that the Constitution written after the 1979 revolution  should remain the centerpiece of the opposition movement. We need to move within an order to avoid violations that could impose further costs on people, he said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n A former senior official close to the opposition said Mr. Moussavi has taken his attacks against the regime one step further up.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Peoples demands on the streets were definitely much more than what the opposition leaders were calling for. Now, with his new remarks Mr. Moussavi is reflecting what is closer to what people want, said the former official in a telephone interview. He spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution inside Iran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In his previous statement issued after a bloody confrontation on Dec. 27, Mr. Moussavi had outlined five demands to defuse the crisis, including the release of political prisoners and freedom of the press.

The United States has been working hard to convince other nations to go along with new and punishing sanctions that it hopes will persuade Iran to stop enriching uranium, while Tehran is trying to stave off those efforts.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Sunday, Defense Secretary\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/robert_m_gates/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Robert M. Gates.&quot;&gt;\n  Robert M. Gates\n &lt;/a&gt;\n expressed disappointment with Irans move, but also said that there was still time for sanctions to work if the international community will stand together and bring pressure to bear on the Iranian government.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Ahmadinejads announcement Sunday came after several days of conflicting signals from him and other Iranian officials about whether they were ready to reopen negotiations about giving up much of their countrys fuel in exchange for enriched uranium from another country. The exchange would allow Iran to meet some of its energy needs, but would ease fears in the West because the fuel sent to Tehran would be in a form that would be very difficult to use  in a bomb.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The deal fell apart when it was rejected by the leadership in Tehran, which says its program is only for peaceful uses.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Ahmadinejads order on Sunday may represent nuclear gamesmanship; it is unclear if the country has the capacity to enrich its fuel to roughly 20 percent, from about 5 percent, as Mr. Ahmadinejad ordered. Doing so  would require retooling the configuration of the nations centrifuges  at a moment when Iran appears to have run into considerable technical difficulties at its nuclear plants.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n It is unclear if those troubles have been caused either by its own technical failings, or sabotage by Western intelligence agencies, or both. American intelligence officials have told Congress and close allies, in closed briefings, that covert efforts to interfere with Irans production capability are extremely active.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Ahmadinejad is betting that the threat of further enrichment itself may force the United States, Europe and Russia to provide fuel on his terms; American officials have said the move would only speed the effort to impose sanctions. It may also affect Israels calculation about how far it is willing to allow Iran to get to a weapons capability before launching an attack on Irans nuclear or missile facilities.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Until now, Iran has never enriched significant quantities of fuel beyond the level needed in ordinary nuclear reactors, part of its argument that its program is for peaceful purposes. But any effort to produce 20 percent enriched uranium would put the country in a position to produce highly-enriched uranium    at the 90 percent level used for weapons    in a comparatively short period of time, according to nuclear experts.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The exchange deal announced in October would have required Iran to ship about 1200 kilograms of its low-enriched uranium to Russia, and then to France, where it would have been produced for the Tehran reactor. But that would have left Iran with too little fuel to produce a weapon, at least for a year or so. The deal was initialed at the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_atomic_energy_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about International Atomic Energy Agency&quot;&gt;\n  International Atomic Energy Agency\n &lt;/a&gt;\n in Vienna more than three months ago, and was supposed to go into effect by Jan. 15. But it became a source of huge contention inside Iran, criticized by both hardliners in the government and leaders of the opposition.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n We have to agree, that deal is dead, said Valerie Lincy, senior associate at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Speaking at a laser technology conference in Tehran Sunday, Mr. Ahmadinejad announced the decision that Iran would produce the fuel itself. He directed Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the atomic energy agency, who was seated in the audience, to move ahead.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Salehi you start enriching up to 20 percent and we are still open to negotiations on the issue, Mr. Ahmadinejad said. He added: The path to cooperation is open, if they come and agree to exchange without preconditions, we will exchange.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n That reference to preconditions, while vague, appeared to reinforce recent Iranian statements that the government was open to a new deal that did not require Iran to give up so much of its existing stockpile, or ship it out of the country. But such a deal has no appeal to\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Barack Obama.&quot;&gt;\n  President Obama\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , his aides have said. For us, the only utility of the agreement was to buy considerable additional time before they could produce a weapon, one of Mr. Obamas strategists said in a recent interview. If the deal doesnt meet that test, were not going ahead.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n According to state-run Press TV in Iran, the country had to take the step to further enrich its uranium because it will run out of fuel for its research reactor, which produces isotopes used for medical purposes.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;pageLinks&quot;&gt;\n &lt;ul id=&quot;pageNumbers&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n   1\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n   &lt;a onclick=&quot;s_code_linktrack(`Article-MultiPagePageNum2`);&quot; title=&quot;Page 2&quot; href=&quot;/2010/02/08/world/middleeast/08iran.html?pagewanted=2&quot;&gt;\n    2\n   &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;/ul&gt;\n &lt;a class=&quot;next&quot; onclick=&quot;s_code_linktrack(`Article-MultiPage-Next`);&quot; title=&quot;Next Page&quot; href=&quot;/2010/02/08/world/middleeast/08iran.html?pagewanted=2&quot;&gt;\n  Next Page\n &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   Michael Slackman reported from Cairo and David E.

But the spokesman, who spoke in return for anonymity under agency rules, said he was not able to confirm Irans claims to be enriching uranium to 20 percent.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Reuters quoted Ali Shirzadian, a spokesman for  Irans Atomic Energy Organization,  as saying that preparatory work had begun  at around 0600 GMT  with enrichment starting within hours.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Iran has indicated that it is seeking to enrich uranium to 20 percent purity, high enough for use in the medical reactor in Tehran but significantly lower than the 90 percent levels needed for weapons. The Western worry is that any effort to produce 20 percent enriched uranium would put the country in a position to produce weapons-grade uranium in a comparatively short time, nuclear experts say.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The I.A.E.A.  confirmed late Monday that it had received a letter from Iran declaring its intent to begin enriching uranium up to 20 percent.\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/yukiya_amano/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Christiane Yukiya Amano.&quot;&gt;\n  Yukiya Amano\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , the director general of the I.A.E.A., noted with concern this decision, as it may affect, in particular, ongoing international efforts to ensure the availability of nuclear fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, the I.A.E.A. said Monday.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n On Tuesday, the spokesman for the I.A.E.A. said Irans declared nuclear facilities were among the most closely monitored in the world after Canada and Japan.  Agency inspectors  routinely measure and monitor nuclear materials and processes to ensure that programs under inspection are those that nuclear authorities have declared.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The spokesman said the inspectors in Natanz were conducting routine safeguards and had not been flown in specifically to scrutinize Irans latest enrichment claims. In the past, Western experts have expressed concern that, apart from its declared nuclear facilities, Iran is pursuing covert development at undisclosed sites.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Those fears deepened last year with the disclosure of a nuclear enrichment plant at Fordo, near the city of Qum. Iran kept the plant a state secret until a few days before the United States and other Western powers disclosed its existence. That site has also been monitored by I.A.E.A. inspectors, Iran says.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The latest developments are unfolding as Iran prepares to celebrate the anniversary of the Islamic revolution in 1979  an event that could intensify the cycle of protests and repression since last Junes flawed presidential elections. But it was not clear if Tehrans display of defiance was designed to shore up its position among Iranians.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The decision to pursue further enrichment  elicited a sharp reaction in the West on Monday.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In Paris, the visiting United States defense secretary,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/robert_m_gates/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Robert M. Gates.&quot;&gt;\n  Robert M. Gates\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , said the Obama administration and its allies had done all they could to entice Iran to negotiate. All of these initiatives have been rejected, he said. While we must still try and find a peaceful way to resolve this issue,  he said, the only path that is left to us at this point, it seems to me, is that pressure track. But it will require all of the international community to work together.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Even in Russia, which along with China has consistently resisted sanctions against Iran, there were calls for stronger action against Tehran. Konstantin I. Kosachyov, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian Parliament, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as urging the international community to prepare serious measures.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n At issue is a proposal for Iran to send its uranium stockpile outside the country to be enriched and processed into fuel rods for use in the medical reactor. This was attractive to the West because it would deprive Iran of stockpiles that it could convert into bomb fuel, while providing Tehran with fuel rods that would be very difficult to use in a weapon. Iran was reported last October to have accepted the proposal, but later backed away. Western officials say Iran has rejected the deal, but Tehran accuses the West of failing to respond to its proposals.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n If Russia does join the other world powers in backing\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Barack Obama.&quot;&gt;\n  President Obama\n &lt;/a&gt;\n s call for tougher United Nations sanctions, that would isolate China, which has said such action could make finding a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis even more difficult.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The United States has begun circulating ideas for possible sanctions among its closest allies on the Security Council and is hoping that Irans announcement might convince China that Tehrans real purpose is to create a weapon, and not the civilian use of\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/info/nuclear-energy?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More articles about nuclear energy.&quot;&gt;\n  nuclear energy\n &lt;/a&gt;\n .\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But news reports on Tuesday quoted a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman , Ma Zhaoxu, as urging continued dialogue and negotiations, refusing to be drawn on the question of sanctions.\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/info/iran-nuclear-program?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;Recent and archival news about Iran`s nuclear program.&quot;&gt;\n  Irans nuclear program\n &lt;/a&gt;\n is one of the most contentious issues between the West and Tehran, which asserts its right under international law to a peaceful nuclear program and rejects Western suspicions that it is seeking to build a nuclear weapon.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The developments have been closely watched by  the Israeli leadership, which has called an Iranian nuclear weapon an existential threat. It remains far from clear that Iran has the capacity to enrich fuel to the level ordered by President\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot;&gt;\n  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , who is apparently seeking to increase pressure on the West to reopen negotiations on providing fuel for the medical reactor on terms more favorable to Tehran.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Indeed, the head of Irans Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, was quoted by Reuters on Monday as suggesting that Tehrans planned enrichment efforts would be halted if Iran received fuel enriched to 20 percent from abroad. He also said a previously announced plan to build 10 new enrichment plants would begin in the next Iranian year starting on March 21, Reuters reported.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_author_id&gt;\n &lt;div id=&quot;authorId&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n   Reporting was contributed by Michael Slackman and Mona el-Naggar from Cairo, David E.

The  unusually strongly worded conclusion seems certain to accelerate Irans confrontation with much of the rest of the world.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The strong suspicions were described in the first report of the new head of the\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_atomic_energy_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about International Atomic Energy Agency&quot;&gt;\n  International Atomic Energy Agency\n &lt;/a&gt;\n ,\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/yukiya_amano/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Christiane Yukiya Amano.&quot;&gt;\n  Yukiya Amano\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , to the agencys board. The report also concluded that Irans weapons-related activity apparently continued beyond 2004, directly contradicting an American intelligence assessment published a little over two years ago, which concluded that work was suspended at the end of 2003. While the intelligence agencies have never renounced that conclusions, several of\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Barack Obama.&quot;&gt;\n  President Obama\n &lt;/a&gt;\n s top national security advisers have said they do not believe the American intelligence estimate. Many in the Bush administration also questioned that conclusion.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The report contains no assessment of how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon, and as recently as early last month administration officials said they believed it would be a year and a half, or maybe significantly longer, before Iran could become a weapons power. But the report cited a series of pieces of new evidence, much of it collected in recent weeks, that appeared to paint a picture of a concerted drive in Iran race toward a weapons capability.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n One senior administration official, told of the main conclusions in the report, said that he thought the speed of the actions described in the document almost suggests the Iranian military is inviting a confrontation. In fact, one theory percolating inside the Obama administration is that Irans\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islamic_revolutionary_guard_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&quot;&gt;\n  Islamic Revolutionary Guard\n &lt;/a&gt;\n Corps or its leading mullahs are betting that an escalation of the nuclear confrontation might distract from the street protests that have rocked the government, and unify the country against outsiders who could be portrayed as trying to suppress Irans rise as a significant power.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n The report said that Iranian officials gave inspectors, who visited the country last week, evidence that the country had successfully enriched uranium to 20 percent purity  well above current levels, but still below the level of enrichment used in a nuclear weapon. So far, the report said, the amounts enriched to that level  which Iran says it needs for a research reactor that makes medical isotopes  are tiny.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n But the report also indicated has now moved the vast majority of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium into the plant doing the higher-level enrichment. It is a curious move: On the one hand, it seems to suggest that the country is preparing to convert all of its stockpile to a higher level of purity, one that could be further enriched to bomb-grade in a matter of months. But the facility where it has been moved is above ground, leaving the stockpile far more vulnerable to military attack.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Perhaps the most startling revelation in the report is that for the first time Iran told inspectors it was preparing to make  its uranium into a metallic form  a step that can be explained by some civilian applications, but is widely viewed as necessary for making the core of an atom bomb. The report does not say what explanation the Iranians offered, if any, for the activity.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Mr. Amanos attitude toward Iran has been closely watched; some officials were concerned that the former Japanese diplomat would be unwilling to directly confront the Iranians in his first months in office. But as one American official said on Thursday, its been clear to us that he recognizes the severity of whats going on.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n In fact, the report detailed Irans past commitments to cease enriching uranium, its decision to go ahead, and its refusal to comply with a series of\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/security_council/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Security Council, U.N.&quot;&gt;\n  United Nations Security Council\n &lt;/a&gt;\n resolutions demanding that it halt its work. It also details questions Iran has refused to answer about evidence that it may have worked on the difficult problems of developing a warhead that could fit atop a missile. since August 2008, Iran has declined to discuss the above issues with the agency or to provide any further insofmraiotn and access to its locations and scientists, it said.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n Altogether, the report said, this raises concerns abou the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed activiies related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<node id="n18553">\n<data key="x">2.36144578313</data>\n<data key="y">0.1</data>\n<data key="label">Obama Set to Offer Stricter Nuclear Deal to Iran</data>\n<data key="date">2010-10-28</data>\n<data key="dummy">0</data>\n<data key="text">&lt;nyt_correction_top&gt;\n&lt;/nyt_correction_top&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n WASHINGTON  The Obama administration and its European allies are preparing a new offer for negotiations with\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More news and information about Iran.&quot; class=&quot;meta-loc&quot;&gt;\n  Iran\n &lt;/a&gt;\n on its nuclear program, senior administration officials say, but the conditions on Tehran would be even more onerous than a deal that the countrys supreme leader, Ayatollah\n &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ali_khamenei/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Ali Khamenei.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;\n  Ali Khamenei\n &lt;/a&gt;\n , rejected last year.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;articleInline runaroundLeft&quot;&gt;\n &lt;!--forceinline--&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;inlineImage module&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;icon enlargeThis&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:pop_me_up2(`http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2010/10/28/IRAN.html`,`IRAN_html`,`width=406,height=630,scrollbars=yes,toolbars=no,resizable=yes`)&quot;&gt;\n     Enlarge This Image\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:pop_me_up2(`http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2010/10/28/IRAN.html`,`IRAN_html`,`width=406,height=630,scrollbars=yes,toolbars=no,resizable=yes`)&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;img src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/10/28/world/IRAN/IRAN-articleInline.jpg&quot; width=&quot;190&quot; height=&quot;283&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n   &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;h6 class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;\n   Khamenei.ir, via Reuters\n  &lt;/h6&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;\n   Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in Qum last week.

But the Iranians have not responded to a request from\n  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/catherine_ashton/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Catherine Ashton.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;\n   Catherine Ashton\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n  , the\n  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the European Union.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;\n   European Union\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n  s foreign policy chief, to meet in Vienna in mid-November. Iran insisted that Ms. Ashton first tell them when sanctions would end, when Israel would give up what it called the Zionist bomb and when the United States would eliminate its\n  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/atomic_weapons/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More articles about nuclear weapons.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;\n   nuclear weapons\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n  .\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  The new offer would require Iran to send more than 4,400 pounds of low-enriched uranium out of the country, an increase of more than two-thirds from the amount required under a tentative deal struck in Vienna a year ago. The increase reflects the fact that Iran has steadily produced more uranium over the past year, and the American goal is to make sure that Iran has less than one bombs worth of uranium on hand.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  Iran would also have to halt all production of nuclear fuel that it is currently enriching to 20 percent  an important step on the way to bomb-grade levels. It would also have to make good on its agreement to negotiate on the future of its nuclear program.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  The failed 2009 accord was scuttled by hard-liners in Tehran. A later analysis by intelligence analysts concluded that Ayatollah Khamenei personally rejected the deal, reversing the judgment of President\n  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/mahmoud_ahmadinejad/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;\n   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n  .\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  For that reason, many officials suspect that this latest initiative is likely to fail. But they say that it fulfills\n  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Barack Obama.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;\n   President Obama\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n  s promise to keep negotiating even while the pressure of sanctions increases.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  This will be a first sounding about whether the Iranians still think they can tough it out or are ready to negotiate, one senior American official said this week, declining to be identified because Washington and its European allies are  debating the final details of the package they will present to Iran. We have to convince them that life will get worse, not better, if they dont begin to move.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  While Mr. Ahmadinejad said in New York last month that Iran was ready to return to negotiations, the country has not yet set a date to meet. Ayatollah Khamenei, speaking earlier this week in Qum  not far from the underground enrichment plant whose existence was exposed last year  did not sound in a mood to compromise.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  The world bullying powers have created a brouhaha about sanctions on Iran, he was quoted in the Iranian press on Tuesday as saying to clerics and students, but this nation has overcome sanctions over the past 30 years with its patience and resistance.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  While all sides have expressed a willingness to engage in new negotiations, what is happening now is more brinkmanship than give-and-take. American officials say it is not crucial for Iran to return to negotiations in earnest right away; the longer they wait, the more time available for sanctions to bite.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  So far, those sanctions have been far more severe than most experts expected. Iran has faced difficulties refueling airplanes in Europe, getting some ports to accept their ships and attracting much-needed investment for oil production, officials and analysts say.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  But the longer the stalemate lasts, the more uranium Iran produces. According to international nuclear inspectors, Iran already has enough fuel for two bombs, though American officials estimate it would take at least a year to enrich its current stockpile to bomb grade and then fabricate it into a weapon. Thats a long time, one American official said recently, enough for the United States or Israel to take military action to stop the program, he contended.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  In public statements recently, the administration has tried to harden its rhetoric about the dangers of an Iranian weapon.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  Gary Samore, Mr. Obamas coordinator for countering unconventional weapons, told an audience at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington last week that if Iran acquired a weapon, it would have an utterly catastrophic effect in the region. If successful, Iran could drive other states in the Persian Gulf to seek their own nuclear weapons. An attack by Israel on Irans facilities, he added, could set off a regional war. Mr. Samore described stopping Irans program as his No. 1 job.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  Two years into office, Mr. Obama has organized an impressive sanctions regime and managed to combine diplomacy and pressure better than many experts had predicted. But so far he has little to show for it, which has prompted a discussion inside the White House about whether it would be helpful, or counterproductive, to have him talk more openly about military options.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  Several European officials have discouraged that approach. But they also worry that negotiating about the fate of uranium that Iran has enriched in violation of Security Council commands could have the effect of convincing the Iranians they could retain some of their enrichment capability at the end of any negotiation.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n  Mr. Obamas campaign in 2008 said that would be unacceptable; as president, he has not addressed the question clearly.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;nyt_correction_bottom&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;articleCorrection&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/nyt_correction_bottom&gt;\n &lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n &lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</data><data key="labelPos">n</data></node>\n<edge id="e0" source="n4707" target="n4890"><data key="l0">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e1" source="n4793" target="n4890"><data key="l3">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e2" source="n4890" target="n4980"><data key="l0">true</data>\n<data key="l3">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e3" source="n4980" target="n5004"><data key="l0">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e4" source="n4980" target="n5043"><data key="l3">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e5" source="n5004" target="n5043"><data key="l0">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e6" source="n5043" target="n6004"><data key="l3">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e7" source="n5274" target="n5305"><data key="l2">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e8" source="n5305" target="n7257"><data key="l2">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e9" source="n6004" target="n9538"><data key="l3">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e10" source="n6714" target="n7634"><data key="l4">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e11" source="n7257" target="n9414"><data key="l2">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e12" source="n7608" target="n7677"><data key="l1">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e13" source="n7634" target="n8003"><data key="l4">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e14" source="n7677" target="n8279"><data key="l1">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e15" source="n8003" target="n8160"><data key="l4">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e16" source="n8160" target="n8957"><data key="l4">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e17" source="n8279" target="n11236"><data key="l1">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e18" source="n8957" target="n18553"><data key="l4">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e19" source="n9414" target="n9462"><data key="l2">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e20" source="n9462" target="n11085"><data key="l2">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e21" source="n11236" target="n11272"><data key="l1">true</data>\n</edge>\n<edge id="e22" source="n11272" target="n11548"><data key="l1">true</data>\n</edge>\n  </graph> </graphml>\' where queryID=615;' ()
