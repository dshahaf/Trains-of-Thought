 &lt;/a&gt;
 .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A drawdown in Iraq is seen as a prerequisite to any significant American military buildup in Afghanistan, where Mr. Obama is ready to add up to 30,000 troops over the next two years, a near doubling of the current American force there of about 31,000.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The broad outlines of the military plan for Iraq presented to Mr. Obama in December envisioned withdrawing two brigades, or some 7,000 to 8,000 troops, over the next six months, officials said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 American military officials have declined to be more specific about other details in that plan, by Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/david_h_petraeus/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; david=&quot;David&quot; h.=&quot;H.&quot; petraeus.=&quot;Petraeus.&quot;&gt;

  Ray Odierno
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the top American commanders responsible for Iraq. But they have made clear that the plan does  not set forth as fast a withdrawal as Mr. Obama pledged during the presidential campaign, when he repeatedly promised to have all combat troops out of Iraq within 16 months of his taking office, or by May 2010.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Officials with Mr. Obamas transition team say he remains committed to that goal, although he has also said he will listen to the recommendations of his commanders. In an interview on Wednesday,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/joseph_r_jr_biden/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; joseph=&quot;Joseph&quot; r.=&quot;R.&quot; biden=&quot;Biden&quot; jr.=&quot;Jr.&quot;&gt;
  Joseph R. Biden Jr.
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the vice president-elect, said he was not prepared to talk about new troop-level options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Brooke Anderson, the national security spokeswoman for the Obama transition team, said, We have had briefings from the Bush administration, including Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen, about current plans for Iraq and Afghanistan, and we appreciate the information that has been shared. Ms. Anderson said that as president Mr. Obama would meet with his commanders to make a determination to how we move forward to safely redeploy our combat brigades in 16 months.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Senior military officers say they have anticipated that Mr. Obama will seek speedier options for Iraq troop withdrawals. But they have also expressed uneasiness about a quick withdrawal from Iraq and are unclear at this point about Mr. Obamas overall strategy in Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It is more than a question of how fast and how low; it includes calculating how much risk you are willing to take in Iraq, one senior military officer said of the discussions over a withdrawal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The official, who asked not to be identified  because of the delicacy  of discussing war planning before the new commander in chief takes office, said the planning also required defining the future mission for American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and goals for where those missions should be in years to come.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Various options are being drawn up to give the new president choices, said another senior military officer involved in the process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, said Mr. Gates intended to make sure that Mr. Obama, once he is commander in chief, gets to hear directly from all of the senior military officers with a stake in the Iraq and Afghanistan missions before making any decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The discussions the secretary and the chairman have had with the president-elect and his team have thus far been very broad, Mr. Morrell said. They will not begin the process of presenting the president-elect with specific options for a way ahead in Iraq until after the inauguration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The current military plan for Iraq was drawn up to meet the recent status-of-forces agreement between the United States and the Iraqi government that calls for both shorter and longer timetables than Mr. Obamas campaign promise. Under that  agreement, all United States combat troops are to be out of Iraqi cities by June and all American forces are to be out of Iraq entirely by the end of 2011. That agreement, however, can be renegotiated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Even as Mr. Obama prepares for the drawdown in Iraq, some influential Democrats and national security experts have begun voicing concern about his willingness to send up to 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan, where the United States has been at war for more than seven years. They say that Mr. Obama has yet to make clear his overall goals beyond calling for more forces, money and diplomacy in an increasingly violent, ungovernable country that the military says presents even more problems than Iraq.

    Gen. Ray Odierno, the top commander in Iraq, met with American soldiers on Wednesday in Jisr Diyala, south of Baghdad.

&lt;p&gt;
 Since taking office last week, Mr. Obama has recommitted to ending the war in Iraq but not to his specific campaign pledge to pull out roughly one combat brigade a month for the first 16 months of his presidency. His top commander in Iraq has proposed a slower start to the withdrawal, warning of the dangers of drawing down too quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 On Wednesday, Mr. Obama visited the Pentagon for the first time since becoming president, and he seemed to be looking for an option that would let him stay true to his campaign promise, at least in theory, without alienating the generals. The White House indicated that Mr. Obama was open to alternatives to his 16-month time frame and emphasized that security was an important factor in his decision.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Were no longer involved in a debate about whether, but how and when,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/robert_gibbs/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; robert=&quot;Robert&quot; gibbs.=&quot;Gibbs.&quot;&gt;
  Robert Gibbs
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the White House press secretary, said about a withdrawal from Iraq. Thats a process the president wants to take seriously.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He added: He wants to ensure the safety of our troops as we remove our combat brigades; wants to, as Ive said repeatedly, provide the responsibility and the opportunity for the Iraqis to do more in governing their own country; and, as I said, to do this in a way that seeks the consultation of all those leaders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Among those consulted by the president was Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/ray_odierno/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; ray=&quot;Ray&quot; odierno.=&quot;Odierno.&quot;&gt;
  Ray Odierno
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the top commander in Iraq, who has developed a plan that would move slower than Mr. Obamas campaign timetable, by pulling out two brigades over the next six months. In an interview in Iraq on Wednesday, General Odierno suggested that it might take the rest of the year to determine exactly when United States forces could be drawn down significantly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I believe that if we can get through the next year peacefully, with incidents about what they are today or better, I think were getting close to enduring stability, which enables us to really reduce, General Odierno said as he inspected a polling center south of Baghdad in advance of provincial elections on Saturday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 General Odierno said the period between this weekends elections and the national elections to be held about a year from now would be critical to determining the future of Iraq. While some American forces could be withdrawn before then, he suggested that the bulk of any pullout would probably come after that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 We are going to reduce forces this year, the general said. Its the right time to reduce our forces here. I believe that Iraqis are making progress. Its time for us in some places to step back and give them more control. He added, What we want to do is to slowly shift our mission from one thats focused on counterinsurgency to one thats more focused on stability operations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 After a session at the White House last week, with General Odierno participating via secure video, Mr. Obama traveled to the Pentagon on Wednesday to meet with the service chiefs. The discussion ranged beyond Iraq and Afghanistan, covering a variety of challenges confronting the armed forces. It was a very elevated conversation about the situation worldwide and the threats that we face and the risks that exist around the globe, said Geoff Morrell, the Defense Department spokesman.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Speaking with reporters afterward, Mr. Obama expressed concern about the enormous pressure on our military to carry out a whole set of missions and promised to advance all aspects of American power to make sure that theyre not carrying the full load. He indicated that he had not decided on his approach to Iraq. Were going to have some difficult decisions that were going to have to make surrounding Iraq and Afghanistan, most immediately, Mr. Obama  said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 J. D. Crouch II, who was President Bushs deputy national security adviser and a leading architect of the surge  strategy, said Mr. Obama and his team would be wise to heed the military. They dont want Iraq to go bad because they have too many other important things to do, he said. They dont want to alienate the military. And theres something to be said that the guy who got things under control over there, Ray Odierno, probably has a good idea of what he needs.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; barack=&quot;Barack&quot; obama.=&quot;Obama.&quot;&gt;
  President Obama
 &lt;/a&gt;
 is nearing a decision that would order American combat forces out of Iraq by August 2010 as he seeks to finally end a war that has consumed and polarized the United States for nearly six years, senior administration officials said Tuesday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The timetable would give the military three months more to withdraw than the 16-month pullout Mr. Obama promised last year on the campaign trail. Officials said he was prepared to make that shift because he agreed with the concerns of ground commanders who wanted more time to cement security gains, strengthen political institutions and make sure Iraq did not become more  unstable again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Even with the withdrawal order, Mr. Obama plans to leave behind a residual force of tens of thousands of troops to continue training Iraqi security forces, hunt down foreign terrorist cells and guard American institutions,  as he said he would during last years campaign.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama, who met with Defense Secretary
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/robert_m_gates/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; robert=&quot;Robert&quot; m.=&quot;M.&quot; gates.=&quot;Gates.&quot;&gt;
  Robert M. Gates
 &lt;/a&gt;
 on Tuesday, has not made a final decision but could complete his review and announce his plan this week, administration officials said. In his speech to Congress on Tuesday night, Mr. Obama said only that he would soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It was not clear on Tuesday exactly how many of the 140,000 troops would remain in Iraq after August 2010 or whether any of the 14 combat brigades now there would  stay under a new mission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The 19-month time frame for the withdrawal of combat troops was first reported Tuesday by The Associated Press. The approach split the difference with military commanders who proposed a range of options, including the 16-month withdrawal Mr. Obama promised last year and a  longer timetable that would have spread the withdrawal over 23 months. Mr. Obamas advisers said they believed they had reached an accommodation that would satisfy both the military and a public eager to get out of Iraq, while relieving the strain on the armed forces and freeing up resources for Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The president has been struck by the fact that there has been a meeting of the minds in a lot of ways among his military advisers about what would be a safe and responsible way to redeploy our troops while protecting our interests in Iraq, said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no decision had been announced.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Another top official said the White House was confident that those who supported Mr. Obamas election would accept a somewhat longer  time frame. Hes always said that he would consult with his military commanders on this and would reach a responsible, appropriate decision, the official said. This is not a very large deviation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The troop withdrawal could also help to ease the budget pressure the White House is facing as Mr. Obama seeks to make good on a promise to cut the federal deficit in half by 2013, when his current term will end.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In recent weeks, Mr. Gates and Adm.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/michael_g_mullen/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; michael=&quot;Michael&quot; g.=&quot;G.&quot; mullen.=&quot;Mullen.&quot;&gt;

 , chairman of the

  Joint Chiefs of Staff
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , discussed the three withdrawal options  16, 19 and 23 months  with the president. Pentagon officials characterized the talks as extensive and said that each option was presented with what Mr. Gates and Admiral Mullen saw as the accompanying risks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Both Mr. Gates and Admiral Mullen made their own recommendations to the president about what they saw as the best option, but Pentagon officials declined to specify them. One senior defense official did say that Mr. Gates has historically always been extremely deferential to his commanders in the field.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The top two commanders responsible for Iraq, Gen.

  Ray Odierno
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , have declined to say what options they preferred, but military officials have made it clear that the two were uncomfortable with the 16-month plan  that Mr. Obama backed during the campaign.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Pentagon officials said Tuesday that they did not know what the size of the residual force in Iraq might be, although one of Mr. Obamas national security advisers said during the campaign that it could number 30,000 to 55,000 troops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Similarly, defense officials said they did not know how many combat troops would stay behind in new missions as trainers, advisers or counterterrorism forces, at least some of whom would still be effectively in combat roles. Military planners have said that in order to meet withdrawal deadlines, they would reassign some combat troops to training and support of the Iraqis, even though the troops would still be armed and go on combat patrols with their Iraqi counterparts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Administration officials said it was possible that Mr. Obama would announce his decision on Iraq  withdrawals on Friday during a visit to North Carolina, possibly at either Camp Lejeune or Fort Bragg. Camp Lejeune is the home of some 8,000
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/us_marine_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; united=&quot;United&quot; states=&quot;States&quot; marine=&quot;Marine&quot; corps=&quot;Corps&quot;&gt;

 who are to be deployed to Afghanistan  under a plan Mr. Obama announced last week to send 17,000 more troops to the country.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; barack=&quot;Barack&quot; obama.=&quot;Obama.&quot;&gt;
  President Obama
 &lt;/a&gt;
 s planned Iraq troop drawdown would leave the bulk of American forces in place until early next year while some combat units would remain in place in new roles even beyond a declared August 2010 target for withdrawal, administration officials said Wednesday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The plan would maintain relatively high troop levels through Iraqs parliamentary elections, to be held in December, before beginning in earnest to meet the August 2010 target for removing combat forces, the officials said. Even after August 2010, as many as 50,000 of the 142,000 troops now in Iraq would remain, including some combat units reassigned as Advisory Training Brigades or Advisory Assistance Brigades, the administration and Pentagon officials said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama consistently said during his campaign that he would leave a residual force for training, protection and counterterrorism missions. But the gradual pace of his withdrawal  spread out over 19 months, instead of the 16 months he promised during the campaign  and the possible size of the remaining force left some Democrats discouraged, while some Republicans cautioned against moving too quickly. The administration  intends to call those remaining troops a transition force.
&lt;/p&gt;

 I dont know what the justification is for 50,000, Representative

  John A. Boehner
 &lt;/a&gt;
 of Ohio, said Mr. Obamas plan might not be realistic and compared it to the presidents decision to close the American detention center in Cuba even though the details would take a year to work out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 What we dont need is another Guantnamo decision that may fly in the face of the facts on the ground, Mr. Boehner told reporters. While it may have sounded good during the campaign, I do think its important that we listen to those commanders and our diplomats who are there to understand how fragile the situation is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama plans to seek more money for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan from a separate fund outside the Pentagons base budget, which will also grow beyond the 2009 spending plan of $513 billion. The separate war costs budget proposal for 2010 could reach $130 billion to $140 billion, officials said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The officials agreed to discuss the withdrawal plan on condition of anonymity in advance of an expected announcement by Mr. Obama during a trip on Friday to Camp Lejeune, N.C. The planned drawdown reflects an attempt to balance competing imperatives, including Mr. Obamas campaign promises, the ground commanders desire to maintain flexibility and guard against any fresh escalation  of sectarian violence, and the militarys need to relieve the strain on the armed forces.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Word of Mr. Obamas impending decision generated little of the anger that has flavored the Iraq debate for years. Justin Ruben, executive director of
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/moveon.org/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; moveon.org=&quot;Moveon.org&quot;&gt;
  MoveOn.org
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , a group that has strongly opposed the war, said activists were willing to give Mr. Obama the benefit of the doubt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 People have confidence that the president is committed to ending the war, Mr. Ruben said. This is basically what he promised in the election.

  John McCain
 &lt;/a&gt;
 of Arizona, the former Republican presidential candidate and a strong supporter of the war, did not take direct issue with Mr. Obamas plan on Wednesday, but noted that there was a huge caveat in the tens of thousands of troops who would be left behind.

 &lt;/a&gt;
 , without discussing details, said the drawdown would satisfy public hunger to begin ending the war. I think the American people will be  understand exactly what were doing and theyll be pleased, he said on
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/nbc_universal/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nbc=&quot;NBC&quot; universal.=&quot;Universal.&quot;&gt;
  NBC
 &lt;/a&gt;
 s Today show. Were keeping a campaign commitment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The withdrawal would start slowly, with 2 of the 14 American combat brigades now in Iraq pulling out before the December elections, officials said. After the transition to a new government, the withdrawal would accelerate early next year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The commanders are concerned about maximizing their numbers on the ground for as long as possible, at least until we get to the other side of the elections, another senior official said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Officers warned that even as overall troop levels dropped, there would be fresh American units deploying to Iraq, both to replace those whose tours end and to reshape the force into one better suited for training and advising Iraqis. While most of the troops remaining after August 2010 would be in support roles, some would still be serving in combat as they conducted counterterrorism missions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I think a limited number of those that remain will conduct combat operations against terrorists, assisting Iraqi security forces, said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, summarizing past descriptions of the new mission offered by  administration and Defense Department officials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Thats a limited number, a very limited number. But by and large, youre talking about people who we would classify as enablers, support troops.

    My highest priority will be the safety and security of our troops and civilians in Iraq, President Obama said at Camp Lejeune, N.C., on Friday.
   &lt;/p&gt;

 Nearly six years after American troops crossed the border into Iraq to topple
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/saddam_hussein/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; saddam=&quot;Saddam&quot; hussein.=&quot;Hussein.&quot;&gt;
  Saddam Hussein
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , Mr. Obama said renewed cause for hope produced by improved security would allow Americans to begin disentangling militarily and turn the country over to the Iraqis themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Let me say this as plainly as I can, the president told thousands of
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/us_marine_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; united=&quot;United&quot; states=&quot;States&quot; marine=&quot;Marine&quot; corps=&quot;Corps&quot;&gt;
  Marines
 &lt;/a&gt;
 stationed here. By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The transitional force he will leave behind will no longer participate in major combat missions but instead train and advise Iraqi security forces, hunt down terrorist cells and protect American civilian and military personnel working in Iraq. Mr. Obama promised that all of them will leave as well by December 2011 in accordance with a security agreement with Iraq negotiated by President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; george=&quot;George&quot; w.=&quot;W.&quot; bush.=&quot;Bush.&quot;&gt;
  George W. Bush
 &lt;/a&gt;
 before he left office last month.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 At the same time, Mr. Obama vowed to continue the American commitment to building a new Iraqi society and to resettling millions of displaced Iraqis still away from home  elsewhere in their own nation or in neighboring countries. And he promised to escalate diplomatic involvement in the broader region, including new lines of communication with Iran and Syria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Every nation and every group must know  whether you wish America good or ill  that the end of the war in Iraq will enable a new era of American leadership and engagement in the Middle East, the president said. And that era has just begun.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The announcement marked a sharp turning point in the American venture in Iraq, one that signaled a shift in the once-fiery political debate at home and in the nations priorities abroad. The choice of Camp Lejeune, the largest Marine base on the East Coast, symbolized the transition because 8,000 troops from here will soon ship out to Afghanistan as part of a 17,000-troop buildup ordered by Mr. Obama.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The reaction to the Iraq drawdown plan indicated an emerging consensus in the United States that it is time to begin getting out. While some leading Congressional Democrats grumbled about the size of the residual force, the drawdown largely won support across party lines, including from leading Republicans like Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/john_mccain/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; john=&quot;John&quot; mccain.=&quot;McCain.&quot;&gt;
  John McCain
 &lt;/a&gt;
 of Arizona, who lost years election to Mr. Obama after a fierce debate over Iraq.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Speaking on the Senate floor on Friday before the presidents speech, Mr. McCain credited the opportunity to pull troops out to the surge that Mr. Bush ordered two years ago with his support. But he cautioned that Iraq remains fragile, urging Mr. Obama to remain flexible and listen to military commanders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 With these factors in mind, I believe the presidents withdrawal plan is a reasonable one, Mr. McCain said. Given the gains in Iraq and the requirements to send additional troops to Afghanistan, together with the significant number of troops that will remain in Iraq and the presidents willingness to reassess based on conditions on the ground, I am cautiously optimistic that the plan as laid out by the president can lead to success.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Former Bush aides also offered support for the plan, calling it the logical next step after the presidents agreement with Iraq to withdraw all forces by the end of 2011. The specific timing is only slightly different but consistent with the goal of helping Iraq become self sufficient in providing its own security, Gordon D. Johndroe, who was Mr. Bushs last national security spokesman, said in an interview. This is possible because of the success of the surge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama called Mr. Bush from a holding room at Camp Lejeune just before going on stage in the base gymnasium to make the announcement, aides said. He called Prime Minister
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/nuri_kamal_al-maliki/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nuri=&quot;Nuri&quot; kamal=&quot;Kamal&quot; al-maliki.=&quot;al-Maliki.&quot;&gt;

  Air Force One
 &lt;/a&gt;
 on the flight from Washington to brief him on the withdrawal plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In Baghdad, Yassen Majeed, an adviser to Mr. Maliki, said the prime minister is very comfortable with the plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The Prime Minister assured the American president that the security situation in Iraq is stable and his forces are ready to take over all the responsibilities from the American side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But others there were more cautious, including Sunni lawmakers worried about their the possible erosion of their influence in the Shiite-dominated government.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Several noted with approval Mr. Obamas statement that the Iraqi government would only have American support as long as it remained non-sectarian. All Iraqis want the American to withdraw from Iraq as soon as possible, said Adnan al-Dulaimi, a senior Sunni politician. Were just afraid of the vacuum that this withdrawal may cause.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 During his speech, Mr. Obama credited troops who got the job done but gave no credit to the troop surge and associated strategy shift that he opposed in January 2007. He praised Ambassador

 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 All that changed when American troops arrived in February. They dropped from helicopters and set up three camps where there had been none, expecting a fight. Instead, the Taliban put up almost no resistance and left for other areas. Now trucks travel freely and merchants no longer fear for their lives.
&lt;/p&gt;

 Compared with last year, its 100 percent different, said Muhamed Zaker, an apple farmer from the area.

 The Jalrez Valley is a test case, the first area in Afghanistan where

 &lt;/a&gt;
 has been applied, and it is a promising early indicator.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But in Afghanistan, a complex patchwork of tribes, ethnicities and rivalries, it remains unclear whether the early success in this area  can be replicated. In the painstaking business of counterinsurgency, security requires more than just extra troops. It means giving Afghans reasons to reject the insurgents by providing the basic trappings of a state  an effective police force, enough government services, and economic opportunity so they can work rather than fight.

 has said the troops here have about a year to show they can turn around the momentum of the war, before Afghan and American patience runs out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But Afghanistan is a country where only a third of the population can read and even the most rudimentary infrastructure is lacking, and commanders on the ground say rushing the process would be a mistake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Its construction, not
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/reconstruction/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; reconstruction=&quot;reconstruction&quot; effort=&quot;effort&quot; in=&quot;in&quot; iraq.=&quot;Iraq.&quot;&gt;
  reconstruction
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , one American officer said, comparing the task with that in Iraq, where the American effort was referred to as reconstruction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 One problem is that the gains in Jalrez could still be temporary. Insurgents regularly leave areas where Americans appear, only to resurface later. We are hearing its better now, said Hoji Mir Ahmad, a fruit merchant based in Kabul, but God knows what things will be like when the harvest comes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 When the Americans came to the Jalrez Valley, a skinny finger of green just 30 miles west of Kabul, the capital, Taliban fighters had controlled it for more than a year, taking advantage of a virtual absence of American troops. A unit of about 200 American soldiers had patrolled an area of half a million people and was so thinly spread that its captain had to drive 12 hours to hold a meeting with a local leader.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Humiliations had become routine: The Taliban would blacken the faces of men they said were thieves and parade them. In Jalrez Bazaar, a town west of the valley, eight people were killed in 2008,  residents said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It looked like we didnt have any destiny, said Momin Shah, a farmer, sitting on a crate in a small supply shop.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Fearing that the Taliban were tightening their hold around Kabul, the Americans were sent to secure the two provinces just south and west of it, Logar and Wardak, the gateway to the capital and the location of the countrys main north-south highway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Then came the first surprise: The Taliban left for other areas rather than fight. Musa Hotak, a member of Parliament from Jalrez District who is a former Taliban commander, said the two main militant leaders had moved with their families to Pakistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The reason, American officers said, was simple math. The new contingent increased the number of  Americans tenfold. Mass counts, said Lt. Col. Kimo Gallahue, a commander in the new battalion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 What is now causing unrest in Jalrez is an assortment of low-level criminals, Americans and Afghans said, men who may be thought of as Taliban, but whose main pursuit is money, not infidels. (The main target in Jalrez is a man whose last big crime was stealing solar panels.) That gives the Americans hope that if they bring money and jobs fast enough here and to the rest country, they could substantially weaken the insurgency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I learned everything I know about the Jalrez insurgency from
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/&quot; title=&quot;Sopranos&quot; web=&quot;Web&quot; site=&quot;site&quot;&gt;
  The Sopranos
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , Colonel Gallahue said. At the foot soldier level, its economically driven.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 For Afghans, life has improved, a fact that, for Jalrez Bazaar residents, has trumped the irritation at having foreign troops on Afghan soil. People hate them but its better to have them here, said Shah Mahmoud, a farmer, 70. If security is established, we dont need the Americans and they dont need us.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In the rules of counterinsurgency, soldiers must move quickly  but carefully  to solidify gains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The Americans are trying to strike a delicate balance between wooing villagers with public works projects and continuing to put pressure on insurgents in the same areas.  Progress is slow.
&lt;/p&gt;

 In a speech intended to highlight his two-day visit, Mr. Obama reached out to national sensibilities here by assuring that American wants a strong, peaceful and prosperous Russia and declaring that it is not for me to define Russias national interests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Yet he made the case that Russia should join America in curbing emerging nuclear powers like Iran and in promoting greater liberties at home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 By no means is America perfect, the president said in a speech at the New Economic School, a graduate school in Moscow formed after the fall of the Soviet Union to introduce modern market economics to Russia. But it is our commitment to certain universal values which allows us to correct our imperfections and to grow stronger over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He added: If our democracy did not advance those rights, I  as a person of African ancestry  wouldnt be able to address you as an American citizen, much less a president.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obamas speech came one day after he signed an agreement in principle with President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/dmitri_a_medvedev/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; dmitri=&quot;Dmitri&quot; a.=&quot;A.&quot; medvedev.=&quot;Medvedev.&quot;&gt;
  Dmitri A. Medvedev
 &lt;/a&gt;
 to cut Russian and American strategic nuclear arsenals by at least one-quarter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 As he began his second day in Moscow, Mr. Obama had breakfast with Prime Minister
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/vladimir_v_putin/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; vladimir=&quot;Vladimir&quot; v.=&quot;V.&quot; putin.=&quot;Putin.&quot;&gt;
  Vladimir V. Putin
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , widely viewed as Russias paramount leader, in a meeting that ran long over its scheduled time. Speaking to reporters beforehand, Mr. Putin noted that there have been periods of grayish mood between our two countries, an allusion to the tension of recent years that culminated with last years war between Russia and its small neighbor, Georgia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 With you, Mr. Putin told Mr. Obama, we link all our hopes for the furtherance of relations between our two countries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Neither man made any public mention of Mr. Obamas comment in an interview last week that Mr. Putin still has one foot in the old ways of doing business. Instead, Mr. Obama lavished praise on Mr. Putin, while stumbling for the second time in as many days over his titles. Im aware of not only the extraordinary work that youve done on behalf of the Russian people in your previous role as prime minister  as president, but in your current role as prime minister.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama came here in hopes of rebuilding relations with Russia after they frayed under his predecessor, President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; george=&quot;George&quot; w.=&quot;W.&quot; bush.=&quot;Bush.&quot;&gt;
  George W. Bush
 &lt;/a&gt;
 . In addition to the nuclear arms agreement, he and Mr. Medvedev sealed a deal allowing the American military to send thousands of flights of troops and weapons to Afghanistan through Russian airspace each year and they renewed military contacts suspended after last years Georgia war.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The two did not reach a trade deal the Obama administration once hoped for, and made no progress in bridging the divide over American plans to build a missile defense system in Eastern Europe. But Mr. Medvedev was pleased that Mr. Obama agreed that they should talk about both offensive and defensive weapons and the American president was pleased that his Russian counterpart agreed to conduct a joint review of any Iranian nuclear threat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama mapped out his second day in part to demonstrate continuing American support for democracy and rule of law in Russia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He met Tuesday morning with
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/mikhail_s_gorbachev/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; mikhail=&quot;Mikhail&quot; s.=&quot;S.&quot; gorbachev.=&quot;Gorbachev.&quot;&gt;
  Mikhail S. Gorbachev
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the former Soviet president who ushered in glasnost and the changes that ultimately unraveled the Soviet Union. Mr. Obama also planned to meet later in the day with business leaders and opposition leaders and attend a conference on civil society. Mr. Medvedev was also invited to the civil society event but declined.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obamas speech at the New Economic School was calculated to address longstanding Russian grievances against America, which many here suspect still seeks to hold Russia down, interfere in its internal affairs and extend its influence into its backyard. But the speech was not carried on any of the major Russian television networks, all of which are controlled by the state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama did not paper over major policy differences and instead argued that Russia should not fear American intentions. Neither America nor Russia would benefit from a nuclear arms race in East Asia or the Middle East, he said. That is why we should be united in opposing North Koreas efforts to become a nuclear power, and preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

 The United States and Iraq have known difficult times together, Mr. Obama said. Now, both of us agree that the bonds forged between Americans and Iraqis in war can pave the way for progress that can be forged in peace.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-President-Obama-and-Prime-Minister-Maliki-of-Iraq-in-Joint-Press-Availability/&quot; title=&quot;White&quot; house=&quot;House&quot; transcript=&quot;transcript&quot; of=&quot;of&quot; remarks=&quot;remarks&quot; by=&quot;by&quot; mr.=&quot;Mr.&quot; obama=&quot;Obama&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; mr.=&quot;Mr.&quot; maliki=&quot;Maliki&quot;&gt;
  a joint appearance in the Rose Garden
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the two leaders sidestepped some of the recent conflicts over details of the withdrawal and security, and they presented a positive portrait of the evolving relationship between the United States and Iraq. Although Mr. Obama conceded there would be some tough days ahead, he said he remained confident that the Iraqi forces would ultimately be able to handle much of their own security so the United States could pull out its combat troops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The president also said he was committed to working with Iraq to persuade the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; united=&quot;United&quot; nations.=&quot;Nations.&quot;&gt;

 to ease international sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The sanctions, which were imposed on

  Saddam Hussein
 &lt;/a&gt;
 s government, require Iraq to pay 5 percent of its oil revenue as war reparations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It would be a mistake for Iraq to continue to be burdened by the sins of a deposed dictator, Mr. Obama said, responding to a question from an Iraqi reporter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Malikis visit to the White House for a series of meetings with Mr. Obama and other administration officials was the highlight of his weeklong trip to the United States. The two leaders met privately in the Oval Office, their first meeting since
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/world/middleeast/01iraq.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  American forces turned over security in cities and towns to Iraqis
 &lt;/a&gt;
 on June 30.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 From working closely with the American forces and the multinational forces, our forces became highly capable, Mr. Maliki said, speaking through an interpreter. And they will continue to do their role and their part to provide the opportunity needed for
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/reconstruction/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; reconstruction=&quot;reconstruction&quot; effort=&quot;effort&quot; in=&quot;in&quot; iraq.=&quot;Iraq.&quot;&gt;
  reconstruction
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , rebuilding and developing Iraq.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 For the White House, the private meeting with the prime minister was a rare public shift away from health care policy-making, which has dominated the presidents week.  Mr. Obama said the United States was eager to move beyond its military relationship with Iraq to encourage more business investment and stable diplomatic relations. Still, about 130,000 United States troops remain in the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Violence continues to be down, and Iraqis are taking responsibility for their future, Mr. Obama said, standing beneath a broiling sun alongside Mr. Maliki. We have been very encouraged by the progress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Maliki said Iraq needed to build upon a strategic relationship on the economic front. He said Iraq planned to convene an investment conference in October for companies eager to look for business opportunities in the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Iraq has suffered a great deal from being marginalized, from the policies of sectarianism and from wars, Mr. Maliki said. We will work very hard not to allow any sectarian behavior and opportunity to flourish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 On his trip to Washington, the prime minister is also scheduled to meet with

 Even before the top commander in Afghanistan submits his proposal for additional forces, administration officials have begun what one called a healthy debate about what the priorities should be and whether more American soldiers and

  NATO
 &lt;/a&gt;
 forces in Afghanistan in June. Mr. Gates has now forwarded the generals report of about 25 pages to Mr. Obama.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Although General McChrystal included no specific force proposals in his review, officials expect him to send a separate request in the coming weeks. Military strategists, including one who has advised General McChrystal, said he might offer three options. The smallest proposed reinforcement, from 10,000 to 15,000  troops, would be described as the high-risk option. A medium-risk option would involve sending about 25,000 more troops, and a low-risk option would call for sending about 45,000 troops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, cautioned that talk about troop levels was speculation. Anyone who tells you that they know how many troops the commander is going to ask for and the options he may or may not present doesnt know what hes talking about, because that has not been determined yet, Mr. Morrell said. He said that Mr. Gates had not made up his mind about what he would recommend to the president.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Gates could be the key adviser on this decision, and some military analysts predicted that he might recommend what Pentagon officials call the Goldilocks option  the medium-risk one in the middle. Because he was first appointed by President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; george=&quot;George&quot; w.=&quot;W.&quot; bush.=&quot;Bush.&quot;&gt;
  George W. Bush
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , Mr. Gates could provide political cover for Mr. Obama should the president reject the biggest possible buildup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Gates has long been worried that a large number of American forces would alienate the Afghan population. But at a news conference with Adm.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/michael_g_mullen/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; michael=&quot;Michael&quot; g.=&quot;G.&quot; mullen.=&quot;Mullen.&quot;&gt;

  Joint Chiefs of Staff
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , Mr. Gates said Thursday that
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/us/politics/04military.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  his concerns about the American footprint
 &lt;/a&gt;
 had been mitigated by General McChrystal, who has indicated that the size of the force is less important than what it does.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Where foreign forces have had a large footprint and failed, in no small part it has been because the Afghans concluded they were there for their own imperial interests and not there for the interests of the Afghan people, Mr. Gates said. But he said that General McChrystals emphasis on reducing civilian casualties and interacting more with Afghans has given us a greater margin of error in that respect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama has already ordered 21,000 additional troops to Afghanistan this year for a total American force of 68,000, on top of 40,000 NATO troops. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Holbrooke pushed for those reinforcements, while Mr. Biden resisted. It is true that Hillary was very forceful; I had some disagreement in degree with her, Mr. Biden later told USA Today. The president ended up landing on a spot that was where she was.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Biden has argued that a sizable increase in resources for Afghanistan invariably means less for Pakistan, a concern born out of his frustration as a senator during the Bush administration pushing for more aid to Islamabad. In some ways, he has told colleagues, Pakistan is more important than Afghanistan because extremism is on the rise there, Al Qaeda has operating room and the government of Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation, remains vulnerable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Other American officials said they worried that General McChrystal simply did not have enough forces to turn around Afghanistan. Mr. Holbrooke just returned from Afghanistan, where he heard from military officers who said they needed more help to execute General McChrystals strategy of protecting the population from the Taliban, rather than just hunting militants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 As the presidents senior uniformed adviser, Admiral Mullen has said he worries about the impact of a buildup on the nations already stretched armed forces. In July, Mr. Gates announced a temporary increase of 22,000 troops in the size of the Army.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mediating the debate will be Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/james_l_jones/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; james=&quot;James&quot; l.=&quot;L.&quot; jones.=&quot;Jones.&quot;&gt;
  James L. Jones
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the national security adviser. My job is to make sure the process works the way the president wants and everybody is at the table, he said. I try to be open-minded and not prejudice anything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He said he would ensure that dissidents got to voice their views to Mr. Obama. He encourages vigorous debate, General Jones said. The thing not to do in a meeting with the president is to sit on your hands and hope you dont get called on, because thats a guarantee that youre going to get called on.

 &lt;/a&gt;
 , a Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, illustrate the growing skepticism
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; barack=&quot;Barack&quot; obama.=&quot;Obama.&quot;&gt;
  President Obama
 &lt;/a&gt;
 is facing in his own party as the White House decides whether to commit more deeply to a war that has begun losing public support, even as American commanders acknowledge that the situation on the ground has deteriorated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Senator Levins comments, made in an interview and in the draft of a speech he will deliver Friday, are significant because his  stature on military matters gives him the ability to sway fellow lawmakers, and his pivotal committee position provides a platform for vetting Mr. Obamas major decisions on troops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Underscoring the increasing unease, the House speaker,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/nancy_pelosi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nancy=&quot;Nancy&quot; pelosi.=&quot;Pelosi.&quot;&gt;
  Nancy Pelosi
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , said earlier on Thursday that the president would face opposition if he sought to fulfill an expected request from Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/stanley_a_mcchrystal/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; stanley=&quot;Stanley&quot; a.=&quot;A.&quot; mcchrystal.=&quot;McChrystal.&quot;&gt;
  Stanley A. McChrystal
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the top commander in Afghanistan, for more American combat troops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I dont think there is a great deal of support for sending more troops to Afghanistan in the country or in Congress, Ms. Pelosi told reporters, emphasizing that she was eager to see a report due from the White House in two weeks on benchmarks to measure the success of the administrations six-month-old strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The White House has begun to indicate that it could be weeks or perhaps much longer before Mr. Obama decides whether to send more troops to Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Administration officials say they want to do a complete review of the effectiveness of the last  troop increase, which will put the American presence at 68,000 troops by years end, an all-time high. They are also digesting a strategic assessment of the Afghan mission that General McChrystal has submitted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A delay on deciding whether to increase American troop levels would also have the political advantage of pushing down the road a split within Mr. Obamas party while he is trying to build coalitions for overhauling the health care system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In the telephone interview on Thursday, Mr. Levin said he was not ruling out sending more troops eventually, but rather insisted that the United States try again on a years-old project: finding a way to expand and accelerate the training of the Afghan security forces.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I just think we should hold off on a commitment to send more combat troops until these additional steps to strengthen the Afghan security forces are put in motion, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Levin, who returned from a trip to Afghanistan just last week, said that the Afghan national army should be increased to 240,000 troops by 2012 from a current goal of 134,000 by next year, and that Afghan national police forces should grow to 160,000 officers from 96,800 in the same period. These troop goals are consistent with General McChrystals planning but would be reached a year earlier, the senator said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Levin acknowledged that more American trainers would be needed to meet that goal, but he said that he did not know how many. In the most recent deployment of 21,000 American troops, about 4,000 were trainers. The last of those forces will not be in place until November.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In counterinsurgency operations, there are sometimes few distinctions between trainers, support troops and combat forces, a fact that Mr. Levin said he recognized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He said the United States should send Afghan  forces more equipment  including rifles, bullets and trucks  and shift more equipment to Afghanistan from stocks now in Iraq.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Finally, Mr. Levin said the administration needed to adopt a plan to separate low-  and midlevel  insurgents from hard-core
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/taliban/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; taliban.=&quot;Taliban.&quot;&gt;
  Taliban
 &lt;/a&gt;
 fighters and commanders. He said the current American efforts to do this had been tentative and halfhearted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Levin, who said he intended to outline his proposal in a speech on the Senate floor on Friday, said he explained his concerns in meetings on Wednesday with Secretary of State

 Mr. Gates has indicated that he is willing to consider a request for more forces. Separate from any troop request forwarded by the commanders in Afghanistan, Mr. Gates has said he will press for more troops and equipment to protect American, allied and Afghan forces from

  improvised explosive devices
 &lt;/a&gt;
 ,  which are the roadside bombs that have been the leading cause of death and injuries in Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Troops for the mission to counter roadside bombs, which potentially could number in the thousands, would include route- clearance teams and ordnance-disposal units  some of the most dangerous jobs in the military  as well as intelligence analysts and medical personnel. They would be in addition to a substantial increase in the number of armored troop transport vehicles sent to Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 While Mr. Levin traveled to Afghanistan last week with two other colleagues, the lawmakers did not agree on all positions.
&lt;/p&gt;

 Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/jack_reed/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; jack=&quot;Jack&quot; reed.=&quot;Reed.&quot;&gt;
  Jack Reed
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , a Rhode Island Democrat, said in an interview that he agreed with the need to speed the training and equipping of the Afghan security forces and to reintegrate any Taliban fighters willing to recognize the Afghan government.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Reed said he was waiting for the analysis by General McChrystal on possible troop increases before making up his mind. What the president has to do is continually point to the fact that
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; al=&quot;Al&quot; qaeda.=&quot;Qaeda.&quot;&gt;
  Al Qaeda
 &lt;/a&gt;
 is operating in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan, he said. Given the chance to reconstitute themselves and operate in those border spaces, theyll pose a threat to the United States.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Representative Adam Smith, a Washington State Democrat on the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees who traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the past week, said he also wanted more information before deciding. But my general position is we have to give General McChrystal what he needs to get the job done, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Other Democrats said Mr. Obama and his military commanders needed to make a more persuasive case to sell the administrations Afghanistan strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 They have a relatively short period of time to show that were on a path thats going to demonstrate positive results, said Representative Earl Pomeroy, a North Dakota Democrat who visited Afghanistan last week. This is our last best chance to change things around.

  Stanley A. McChrystal
 &lt;/a&gt;
 s report
 as a blunt and impassioned last-chance plea for a revamped counterinsurgency strategy bolstered by thousands more combat troops to rescue the beleaguered, eight-year mission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Or he could read it as a searing indictment of American-led
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/north_atlantic_treaty_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; north=&quot;North&quot; atlantic=&quot;Atlantic&quot; treaty=&quot;Treaty&quot; organization.=&quot;Organization.&quot;&gt;
  NATO
 &lt;/a&gt;
 military operations and a corrupt Afghan civilian government, pitted against a surprisingly adaptive and increasingly dangerous insurgency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Either way, General McChrystals 66-page report with the deceptively bland title Commanders Initial Assessment is serving to catalyze the thinking of a president  who is keenly aware of the historical perils of a protracted, faraway war  about what he can realistically accomplish in this conflict, and whether his vision for the war and a commitment of American troops is the same as his generals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama faces a deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, growing opposition to the war at home from Democrats and a desire to put off any major troop decision while he still needs much political capital to pass major health care legislation in Congress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But even as
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/world/asia/21prexy.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  the president expresses skepticism about sending more American troops
 &lt;/a&gt;
 to Afghanistan until he has settled on the right strategy, he is also grappling with a stark reality: it will be very hard to say no to General McChrystal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama has called Afghanistan a war of necessity, and in the most basic terms he has the same goal as President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; george=&quot;George&quot; w.=&quot;W.&quot; bush.=&quot;Bush.&quot;&gt;
  George W. Bush
 &lt;/a&gt;
 did after the Sept. 11 attacks, to prevent another major terrorist assault.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Whatever decisions I make are going to be based first on a strategy to keep us safe, then well figure out how to resource it,

 &lt;/a&gt;
 .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Were not going to put the cart before the horse and just think by sending more troops were automatically going to make Americans safe, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The White House expects General McChrystals request to be not just for American troops but for NATO forces as well. This week, the White House is sending questions about his review back to the general in Kabul, Afghanistan, and expects to get responses by the end of next week.
&lt;/p&gt;

 fighters into Afghan society could affect General McChrystals troop request.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama has had only one meeting so far on the McChrystal review, but aides plan to schedule three or four more after he returns from the Group of 20 summit meeting in Pittsburgh at the end of this week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Aides said it should take weeks, not months, to make a decision. The presidents been very clear in our discussion that hes open-minded and hes not going to be swayed by political correctness one way or the other, Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/james_l_jones/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; james=&quot;James&quot; l.=&quot;L.&quot; jones.=&quot;Jones.&quot;&gt;
  James L. Jones
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the national security adviser, said in an interview. Different people are going to have different opinions, and he wants to hear them, but at the end of the day, hes going to do what he thinks is the right thing for the United States and most especially for the men and women who have to respond to his orders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Senior officers who work with General McChrystal say he was surprised by the dire condition of the Afghan mission when he assumed command in June.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 His concerns went beyond the strength and resilience of the insurgency. General McChrystal was surprised by the lack of efficient military organization at the NATO headquarters and that a significant percentage of the troops were not positioned to carry out effective counterinsurgency operations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 There was a sense among General McChrystals staff that the military effort in Afghanistan was disjointed and had not learned from the lessons of the past years of the war.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 We havent been fighting in Afghanistan for eight years, said one officer. Weve been fighting in Afghanistan for one year, eight times in a row.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In his assessment, General McChrystal also portrayed a more sophisticated Taliban foe that uses propaganda effectively and taps into the Afghan prison system as a training ground.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Taliban leaders based in Pakistan appoint shadow governors for most provinces, install their own courts, levy taxes, conscript fighters and wield savvy propagandists. They stand in sharp contrast to a corrupt and inept government.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 And Taliban fighters exert control not only through bombs and bullets. The insurgents wage a silent war of fear, intimidation and persuasion throughout the year  not just during the warmer weather fighting season  to gain control over the population, the general said in his report.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Administration officials said that the generals assessment, while very important, was just one component in the presidents thinking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  Asked on CNN on Sunday
 &lt;/a&gt;
 why after eight months in office he was still searching for a strategy, Mr. Obama took issue. We put a strategy in place, clarified our goals, but what the election has shown, as well as changing circumstances in Pakistan, is that this is going to be a very difficult operation, he said, referring to the Afghan election. Weve got to make sure that were constantly refining it to keep our focus on what our primary goals are.

&lt;/p&gt;

 General McChrystal is expected to ask for as many as 40,000 additional troops for the eight-year-old war, a number that has generated concern among top officers like Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the

 &lt;/a&gt;
 chief of staff, who worry about the capacity to provide more soldiers at a time of stress on the force, officials said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The competing advice and concerns fuel a pivotal struggle to shape the presidents thinking about a war that he inherited but may come to define his tenure. Among the most important outside voices has been that of former Secretary of State
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/colin_l_powell/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; colin=&quot;Colin&quot; l.=&quot;L.&quot; powell.=&quot;Powell.&quot;&gt;
  Colin L. Powell
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , a retired four-star Army general, who visited Mr. Obama in the Oval Office this month and expressed skepticism that more troops would guarantee success.

 &lt;/a&gt;
 , considered by White House aides to be  most influential in this current debate. All have  expressed varying degrees of doubt about the wisdom of sending more forces to Afghanistan.

 Mr. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has warned of repeating the mistakes of Vietnam, where he served, and has floated the idea of a more limited counterterrorist mission. Mr. Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and an Army veteran, has not ruled out supporting more troops but said the burden of proof was on commanders to justify it.

  Robert M. Gates
 &lt;/a&gt;
 .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr.  Gates has not endorsed General McChrystals request yet, viewing the situation as complicated, said one person who has spoken with him. But Mr. Gates, who will be an influential voice in Mr. Obamas decision, has also left open the door for more troops and warned of the consequences of failure in Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Although Mr. Obama has called Afghanistan a war of necessity, he has left members of both parties uncertain about the degree of his commitment to a large and sustained military presence. Even some advisers said they thought Mr. Obamas support for the war as a senator and presidential candidate was at least partly a way of contrasting it with what he saw as a reckless war in Iraq.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 His decision to send 21,000 more troops to Afghanistan early this year, which will bring the number of American troops there to 68,000 this fall, was made hurriedly within weeks of coming into office to stanch the tactical erosion on the ground and provide security during Afghan elections.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But with those elections now marred by
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/09/21/world/asia/0921-afghan-election-analysis.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; graphic=&quot;graphic&quot;&gt;
  fraud allegations
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the latest troop request is forcing Mr. Obama to decide whether he wants to fully engage in Afghanistan for the rest of his term or make a drastic change of course. Some advisers said the varying views reflected the complicated nature of a debate. The troop request follows the strategy unveiled by Mr. Obama in March to focus more on protecting the Afghan population, building infrastructure and improving governance, rather than just hunting the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/taliban/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; taliban.=&quot;Taliban.&quot;&gt;

 &lt;/a&gt;
 . On Friday, a
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; united=&quot;United&quot; nations.=&quot;Nations.&quot;&gt;
  United Nations
 &lt;/a&gt;
 report said that from January to August, 1,500 civilians were killed, about two-thirds of them by militants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Admiral Mullen has endorsed the idea of more troops and will be at the table representing the military. General McChrystal and ambassadors from the region will get a chance to participate in  meetings with the president through a secure video hookup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Other officers, who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan and say they admire General McChrystal nonetheless, have privately expressed doubt that additional troops will make a difference. Others question the broader impact of such a buildup on the overall armed forces.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 If a request for more forces comes to the Army, well have to assess what that will do in terms of stress on the force, said an  Army official, who asked not to be identified because  General McChrystals troop request had not been made  public.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 General Casey, whose institutional role as Army chief is to protect his force, has a goal  to increase by 2012 a soldiers time at home, to two years at home for every year served, from the current one year for every year of duty in Iraq or Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Advisers who have Mr. Obamas ear have raised other questions. Mr. Powell spoke with Mr. Obama about a variety of topics, but his remarks on Afghanistan resonated in the White House. The question the president has to answer is, What will more troops do? Mr. Powell told reporters before a speech in California last week. You have to not just add troops. You need a clear definition of your mission and then you can determine whether you need more troops or other resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In an interview, Senator Kerry, who met with Admiral Mullen last week, said that he had not made up his mind about the troop buildup, but that in Vietnam, the underlying assumptions were flawed, and the number of troops werent going to make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Senator Reed, who met with Mr. Biden, was more measured, but said the president needed to look at the capacity of Afghan forces and the prospects of reconciliation with moderate Taliban members. You want to make sure you have the best operational plan to carry out the strategy, he said.

 Meeting with leaders from both parties at the White House, Mr. Obama seemed to be searching for some sort of middle ground, saying he wanted to dispense with the straw man argument that this is about either doubling down or leaving Afghanistan, as White House officials later described his remarks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But as the war approached its eight-year anniversary on Wednesday, the session underscored the perilous crosscurrents awaiting Mr. Obama. While some Democrats said they would support whatever he decided, others challenged him about sending more troops. And Republicans pressed him to order the escalation without delay, leading to a pointed exchange between the president and Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/john_mccain/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; john=&quot;John&quot; mccain.=&quot;McCain.&quot;&gt;
  John McCain
 &lt;/a&gt;
 of Arizona, his Republican opponent from last years election.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. McCain told the president that time is not on our side. He added, This should not be a leisurely process, according to several people in the room.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A few minutes later, Mr. Obama replied, John, I can assure you this wont be leisurely, according to several attendees. No one feels more urgency to get this right than I do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Still, compared with the harsh debate over health care, the tone was civil and restrained during the 75-minute meeting in the State Dining Room as Mr. Obama, Vice President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/joseph_r_jr_biden/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; joseph=&quot;Joseph&quot; r.=&quot;R.&quot; biden=&quot;Biden&quot; jr.=&quot;Jr.&quot;&gt;
  Joseph R. Biden Jr.
 &lt;/a&gt;
 and about 30 members of Congress gathered around a large table with only glasses of water and notebooks in front of them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama summoned the lawmakers to assure them that he would keep their concerns in mind as he considered the request of his commander in Afghanistan, Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/stanley_a_mcchrystal/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; stanley=&quot;Stanley&quot; a.=&quot;A.&quot; mcchrystal.=&quot;McChrystal.&quot;&gt;
  Stanley A. McChrystal
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , for as many as 40,000 more troops. The president plans to meet with his national security team on Wednesday to talk about Pakistan and on Friday to talk about Afghanistan. Aides plan to schedule one more meeting before he decides on General McChrystals proposal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Several administration officials and lawmakers who attended the session on Tuesday said Mr. Obama was intent on using it to dismiss any impression that he would consider pulling out of Afghanistan. There is no option that would entail a dramatic reduction in troops, said one administration official, who, like others quoted in this article, requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden made it clear that
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  the option Mr. Biden had proposed
 &lt;/a&gt;
 was not a pure counterterrorism alternative, relying only on drones and Special Forces to track down leaders of
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; al=&quot;Al&quot; qaeda.=&quot;Qaeda.&quot;&gt;
  Al Qaeda
 &lt;/a&gt;
 . Instead, Mr. Bidens approach would increase the use of such surgical strikes while leaving the overall size of the American force in Afghanistan roughly at the 68,000 troops currently authorized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 And in the final moments of the meeting, Mr. Obama sought to put to rest suspicions of friction with General McChrystal. Im the one who hired him, Mr. Obama said, according to participants. I put him there to give me a frank assessment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A joint appearance afterward on the White House driveway by the two top Democratic Congressional leaders demonstrated Mr. Obamas political challenge. The one thing that I thought was interesting was that everyone, Democrats and Republicans, said whatever decision you make, well support it basically, said Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/harry_reid/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; harry=&quot;Harry&quot; reid.=&quot;Reid.&quot;&gt;
  Harry Reid
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the majority leader.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But Representative
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/nancy_pelosi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nancy=&quot;Nancy&quot; pelosi.=&quot;Pelosi.&quot;&gt;
  Nancy Pelosi
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the House speaker, smiled and raised her eyebrows in apparent disagreement. Whether we agreed with it or voted for it remains to be seen when we see what the president puts forth, she said. But I think there was a real display of universal respect for the manner in which he was approaching it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 At least three Democrats  Ms. Pelosi; Senator Carl Levin, the Armed Services Committee chairman; and Representative David R. Obey, the Appropriations Committee chairman  voiced reservations during the meeting about increasing troops, according to those in attendance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 There were a number of people who spoke out with a lot of caution about getting in deeper and what the endpoint is, Mr. Levin said in an interview. Mr. Levin, who promoted accelerated training of Afghan forces, then met alone with Mr. Obama  to expand on his views.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Others shared their skepticism in interviews. Clearly, there is hesitancy about the prospect of sending 40,000 more troops, said Representative
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/nita_m_lowey/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nita=&quot;Nita&quot; m.=&quot;M.&quot; lowey.=&quot;Lowey.&quot;&gt;

 &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/john_kerry/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; john=&quot;John&quot; kerry.=&quot;Kerry.&quot;&gt;
  John Kerry
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said after the meeting that it would be irresponsible to send more troops until it became clear what is possible in Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Some Democrats were more supportive of General McChrystals request, including Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/dianne_feinstein/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; dianne=&quot;Dianne&quot; feinstein.=&quot;Feinstein.&quot;&gt;
  Dianne Feinstein
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , head of the  intelligence committee, and Representative Ike Skelton, head of the  Armed Services Committee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I said the real war in Afghanistan did not start until March, when the president made the speech on strategy, Mr. Skelton said in an interview, referring to the strategy Mr. Obama put in place shortly after taking office. There was no strategy before that, he said, and so the president ought to give General McChrystal what he needs to execute it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Republicans pressed even harder. After the meeting, Mr. McCain warned against any middle ground. Half measures is what I worry about, he said. Citing the Bush administrations experience in Iraq, he added that half measures lead to failure over time and an erosion of American public support.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama separately pointed to American successes against Al Qaeda in a series of recent missile strikes and Special Forces raids. During a visit to the National Counterterrorism Center just outside Washington on Tuesday, he said Al Qaeda had lost operational capacity but he vowed to continue pressing the battle to cripple the network around the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 White House officials said the presidents visit was not related to the Afghanistan review. But the public focus on efforts to eliminate Al Qaedas top hierarchy through surgical strikes could provide political cover for Mr. Obama should he reject the most expansive request for 40,000 more troops.
&lt;/p&gt;

 WASHINGTON  Eight years to the day after the start of the war in Afghanistan, the White House and Congress were agonizing on Wednesday about what to do next in that isolated, mountainous country that has been called the graveyard of empires.

 A day after telling Congressional leaders that he would not substantially reduce American forces in Afghanistan or shift the mission to just hunting terrorists there,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; barack=&quot;Barack&quot; obama.=&quot;Obama.&quot;&gt;
  President Obama
 &lt;/a&gt;
 was scheduled to confer with his national security team Wednesday afternoon on Afghanistan and Pakistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The session at the White House, which was expected to last at least until early evening,  was one of several official gatherings in the capital on American policy in Afghanistan. So far, President Obama appears to be undecided about how to respond to the proposal by his commanding general for a major troop buildup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Were at a process of going through this fairly systematically,

  Robert Gibbs
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the presidents chief spokesman, said before the White House discussion.  Emphasizing that the talk would go well beyond troop levels, Mr. Gibbs said, I think everybody is waiting for people to walk out of a room and give everybody a number.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Gibbs said the president had received a formal request for troops from the commander in Afghanistan, Gen.

&lt;p&gt;
 On Capitol Hill, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was scheduled to hear from a panel of experts on Wednesday afternoon on the threat from
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; al=&quot;Al&quot; qaeda.=&quot;Qaeda.&quot;&gt;
  Al Qaeda
 &lt;/a&gt;
 in Afghanistan and beyond.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 There have also been scattered antiwar protests in Washington timed for the anniversary, although none as large or emotional as those of the Vietnam era.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 For the moment, President Obama seemed to be searching for some sort of middle ground, saying he wanted to dispense with the straw man argument that this is about either doubling down or leaving Afghanistan, as White House officials described his remarks on Tuesday during a meeting with leaders from both parties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The meeting on Tuesday and the series of Afghanistan-related events on Wednesday underscored the perilous crosscurrents awaiting Mr. Obama. While some Democrats said on Tuesday that they would support whatever he decided to do, others challenged him about sending more troops. And Republicans pressed him to order the escalation without delay, leading to a pointed exchange between the president and Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/john_mccain/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; john=&quot;John&quot; mccain.=&quot;McCain.&quot;&gt;
  John McCain
 &lt;/a&gt;
 of Arizona, his Republican opponent from last years election.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. McCain told the president that time is not on our side. He added, This should not be a leisurely process, according to several people in the room.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A few minutes later, Mr. Obama replied, John, I can assure you this wont be leisurely, according to several attendees. No one feels more urgency to get this right than I do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Still, compared with the harsh debate over health care, the tone was civil and restrained during the 75-minute meeting in the State Dining Room as Mr. Obama, Vice President Biden and about 30 members of Congress gathered around a large table with only glasses of water and notebooks in front of them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama had summoned the lawmakers to assure them that he would keep their concerns in mind as he considered the request of General McChrystal for as many as 40,000 more troops. Several administration officials and lawmakers who attended the session on Tuesday said Mr. Obama was intent on using it to dismiss any impression that he would consider pulling out of Afghanistan. There is no option that would entail a dramatic reduction in troops, said one administration official, who, like others quoted in this article, requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden made it clear that the option Mr. Biden had proposed was not a pure counterterrorism alternative, relying only on drones and Special Forces to track down leaders of Al Qaeda. Instead, Mr. Bidens approach would increase the use of such surgical strikes while leaving the overall size of the American force in Afghanistan roughly at the 68,000 troops currently authorized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 And in the final moments of the meeting, Mr. Obama sought to put to rest suspicions of friction with General McChrystal. Im the one who hired him, Mr. Obama said, according to participants. I put him there to give me a frank assessment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A joint appearance afterward on the White House driveway by the two top Democratic Congressional leaders demonstrated Mr. Obamas political challenge. The one thing that I thought was interesting was that everyone, Democrats and Republicans, said whatever decision you make, well support it basically, said Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/harry_reid/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; harry=&quot;Harry&quot; reid.=&quot;Reid.&quot;&gt;

  Nancy Pelosi
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the House speaker, smiled and raised her eyebrows in apparent disagreement. Whether we agreed with it or voted for it remains to be seen when we see what the president puts forth, she said. But I think there was a real display of universal respect for the manner in which he was approaching it.

  David R. Obey
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the Appropriations Committee chairman  voiced reservations during the meeting about increasing troops, according to those in attendance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 There were a number of people who spoke out with a lot of caution about getting in deeper and what the endpoint is, Mr. Levin said in an interview. Mr. Levin, who promoted accelerated training of Afghan forces, then met alone with Mr. Obama to expand on his views.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Others shared their skepticism in interviews. Clearly, there is hesitancy about the prospect of sending 40,000 more troops, said Representative
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/nita_m_lowey/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nita=&quot;Nita&quot; m.=&quot;M.&quot; lowey.=&quot;Lowey.&quot;&gt;

  John Kerry
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said after the meeting that it would be irresponsible to send more troops until it became clear what is possible in Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Some Democrats were more supportive of General McChrystals request, including Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/dianne_feinstein/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; dianne=&quot;Dianne&quot; feinstein.=&quot;Feinstein.&quot;&gt;
  Dianne Feinstein
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , head of the intelligence committee, and Representative Ike Skelton, head of the Armed Services Committee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I said the real war in Afghanistan did not start until March, when the president made the speech on strategy, Mr. Skelton said in an interview, referring to the strategy Mr. Obama put in place shortly after taking office. There was no strategy before that, he said, and so the president ought to give General McChrystal what he needs to execute it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Republicans pressed even harder. After the meeting, Mr. McCain warned against any middle ground. Half measures is what I worry about, he said. Citing the Bush administrations experience in Iraq, he added that half measures lead to failure over time and an erosion of American public support.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama separately pointed to American successes against Al Qaeda in a series of recent missile strikes and Special Forces raids. During a visit to the National Counterterrorism Center just outside Washington on Tuesday, he said Al Qaeda had lost operational capacity but he vowed to continue pressing the battle to cripple the network around the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 White House officials said the presidents visit was not related to the Afghanistan review. But the public focus on efforts to eliminate Al Qaedas top hierarchy through surgical strikes could provide political cover for Mr. Obama should he reject the most expansive request for 40,000 more troops. (The American campaign in Afghanistan began on Oct. 7, 2001, with raids by United States and British planes against suspected sanctuaries of the

  President Obama
 &lt;/a&gt;
 are preparing three options for escalating the war effort in Afghanistan, all of them calling for more American troops, as he moves closer to a decision on the way forward in the eight-year-old war, officials said Saturday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The options include Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/stanley_a_mcchrystal/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; stanley=&quot;Stanley&quot; a.=&quot;A.&quot; mcchrystal.=&quot;McChrystal.&quot;&gt;
  Stanley A. McChrystal
 &lt;/a&gt;
 s request for roughly another 40,000 troops; a middle scenario sending about 30,000 more troops; and a lower alternative involving 20,000 to 25,000 reinforcements, according to the officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Officials hope to present the options to Mr. Obama this week before he leaves on a trip to Asia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 While some civilian and military officials believe Mr. Obama is seeking a middle ground in the debate over Afghanistan, aides denied he has made any decision or is leaning toward any of the options. Still, Defense Secretary
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/robert_m_gates/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; robert=&quot;Robert&quot; m.=&quot;M.&quot; gates.=&quot;Gates.&quot;&gt;
  Robert M. Gates
 &lt;/a&gt;
 appears to be supportive of the middle option, some officials said, and his view is thought to be pivotal because of Mr. Obamas respect for him and his status as a holdover from a Republican administration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The three options define the contours of a debate that has played out in public for more than two months. General McChrystal, the top American and allied commander in Afghanistan, and his advocates argue the war cannot be won without a major infusion of forces to protect the population and ultimately turn it against the

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; al=&quot;Al&quot; qaeda.=&quot;Qaeda.&quot;&gt;
  Al Qaeda
 &lt;/a&gt;
 is primarily located. There are currently 68,000 American troops in Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The range of alternatives under discussion suggests that the president has rejected the extremes on either end. He appears inclined to send more troops  with the only question being how many  and seems not to be seriously considering General McChrystals highest proposal of 80,000 more troops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Still, any of the options on the table would generate opposition on either the political left or right. If he approves anything less than General McChrystals 40,000-troop option, Mr. Obama could face criticism from Republicans and some moderate Democrats, while any troop increase would provoke anger among liberals and others who have increasingly soured on the war.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 McClatchy Newspapers
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/78516.html&quot; title=&quot;The&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  reported
 &lt;/a&gt;
 Saturday that Mr. Obama is nearing a decision to approve the middle option being drawn up by advisers, citing unnamed administration and military officials. White House officials denied Mr. Obama has made a decision or favors any of the options at this point, noting that they have not been formally presented to him. But administration officials confirmed that the 30,000-troop plan is under consideration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 If he were to go with that, Mr. Obama could try to make up the difference in what General McChrystal wants by pressing
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/north_atlantic_treaty_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; north=&quot;North&quot; atlantic=&quot;Atlantic&quot; treaty=&quot;Treaty&quot; organization.=&quot;Organization.&quot;&gt;
  NATO
 &lt;/a&gt;
 allies to do more. Britain has already agreed to send another 500 troops, and four senior American officials flew to Brussels last week to brief representatives of other nations that have forces in Afghanistan, to solicit their views and build support for more help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 There could be variations within each of the three options as well that could increase or decrease the number of troops needed, officials said. Troop levels would hinge, for instance, on the administrations assessment of how many former Taliban fighters can be peacefully reintegrated into Afghan society and to what extent improved governance at various levels could prevent disaffected Afghans from siding with insurgents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Officials are focusing on an approach predicated on the belief that the Taliban cannot be entirely eradicated in Afghanistan and that Al Qaeda is the real threat to American interests. The main goal for American forces, then, would be to protect the 10 most important population centers in Afghanistan and keep the Taliban isolated long enough to train Afghan security forces to take over the fight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama has met with his national security advisers seven times since General McChrystal sent his assessment Aug. 31. Officials hope to schedule another meeting this week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The presidents departure for Asia was delayed a day until Thursday so that he can fly to

&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama is to consider four final options in a meeting with his national security team on Wednesday, his press secretary,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/robert_gibbs/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; robert=&quot;Robert&quot; gibbs.=&quot;Gibbs.&quot;&gt;
  Robert Gibbs
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , told reporters. The options outline different troop levels, other officials said, but they also assume different goals  including how much of Afghanistan the troops would seek to control  and different time frames and expectations for the training of Afghan security forces.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Three of the options call for specific levels of additional troops. The low-end option would add 20,000 to 25,000 troops, a middle option calls for about 30,000, and another embraces Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/stanley_a_mcchrystal/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; stanley=&quot;Stanley&quot; a.=&quot;A.&quot; mcchrystal.=&quot;McChrystal.&quot;&gt;
  Stanley A. McChrystal
 &lt;/a&gt;
 s request for roughly 40,000 more troops. Administration officials said that a fourth option was added only in the past few days. They declined to identify any troop level attached to it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Gates, a Republican who served as President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; george=&quot;George&quot; w.=&quot;W.&quot; bush.=&quot;Bush.&quot;&gt;
  George W. Bush
 &lt;/a&gt;
 s last defense secretary, and who commands considerable respect from the president, is expected to be pivotal in Mr. Obamas decision. But administration officials cautioned that Mr. Obama had not yet made up his mind, and that other top advisers, among them Vice President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/joseph_r_jr_biden/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; joseph=&quot;Joseph&quot; r.=&quot;R.&quot; biden=&quot;Biden&quot; jr.=&quot;Jr.&quot;&gt;

 &lt;/a&gt;
 and the White House chief of staff,

  Rahm Emanuel
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , remained skeptical of the value of a buildup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In the Situation Room meetings and other sessions, some officials have expressed deep reservations about President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/hamid_karzai/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; hamid=&quot;Hamid&quot; karzai.=&quot;Karzai.&quot;&gt;
  Hamid Karzai
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , who emerged the victor of a disputed Afghan election. They said there was no evidence that Mr. Karzai would carry through on promises to crack down on corruption or the drug trade or that his government was capable of training enough reliable Afghan troops and police officers for Mr. Obama to describe a credible exit strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Officials said that although the president had no doubt about what large numbers of United States troops could achieve on their own in Afghanistan, he repeatedly asked questions during recent meetings on Afghanistan about whether a sizable American force might undercut the urgency of the preparations of the Afghan forces who are learning to stand up on their own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Hes simply not convinced yet that you can do a lasting counterinsurgency strategy if there is no one to hand it off to, one participant said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama, officials said, has expressed similar concerns about Pakistans willingness to attack
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/taliban/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; taliban.=&quot;Taliban.&quot;&gt;
  Taliban
 &lt;/a&gt;
 leaders who are operating out of the Pakistani city of Quetta and commanding forces that are mounting attacks across the border in Afghanistan. While Pakistan has mounted military operations against some Taliban groups in recent weeks, one official noted, its been focused on the Taliban who are targeting the Pakistani government, but not those who are running operations in Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama himself seems to be hedging his bets, particularly on the performance of Mr. Karzai, who is considered by American officials to be an unreliable partner and is now widely derided in the White House. Mr. Obama told ABC News during an interview on Monday that given the weakness of the Karzai government in Kabul, his administration was seeking provincial government actors that have legitimacy in the right now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Officials said that while Admiral Mullen and Mrs. Clinton were generally in sync with Mr. Gates in supporting an option of about 30,000 troops, there were variations in their positions and they were not working in lock step. Admiral Mullens spokesman, Capt. John Kirby, said that the admiral was providing his advice to the president in private and would not comment. Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, would not comment on Mr. Gatess position.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A focus of Mr. Obamas meeting on Wednesday with his national security advisers, officials said, will be to discuss some of their differences as well as those of the presidents other advisers. Officials also said there was a possibility that Mr. Obama might choose to phase in additional troops over time, with a schedule that depended on the timing of the arrival of any additional
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/north_atlantic_treaty_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; north=&quot;North&quot; atlantic=&quot;Atlantic&quot; treaty=&quot;Treaty&quot; organization.=&quot;Organization.&quot;&gt;
  NATO
 &lt;/a&gt;
 troops and on how soon Afghan security forces would be able to do more on their own.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Officials said that no decision was expected from Mr. Obama on Wednesday, but that he would mull over the discussions at the meeting during a trip to Asia that begins Thursday. Mr. Obama is not due back in Washington until next Thursday.  Officials said that it was possible that he could announce his decision in the three days before Thanksgiving, which is on Nov. 26, but that an announcement in the first week of December seemed more likely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Should Mr. Obama choose to send about 30,000 troops, a military official said, brigades would most likely be sent from the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., and the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, N.Y. In addition, 4,000 troops would be sent as trainers for the Afghan security forces, the military official said. A brigade is about 3,500 to 5,000 soldiers.

  Jack Reed
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the Rhode Island Democrat who has been an influential adviser in the Afghanistan debate, said that one of the most difficult issues was determining the effects of a large American troop presence on the country.
&lt;/p&gt;

 Its more about, hey, are we creating such a large footprint that its easier for the Afghans to walk way from their responsibility? Mr. Reed said. I dont think thats one that can be resolved. Youre making a judgment about that one, and not one you can solve with arithmetic.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/afghanistan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; afghanistan.=&quot;Afghanistan.&quot;&gt;
  Afghanistan
 &lt;/a&gt;
 .
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 After eight years  some of those years in which we did not have, I think, either the resources or the strategy to get the job done  it is my intention to finish the job, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He said that he would outline his Afghanistan strategy after Thanksgiving, adding, I feel very confident that when the American people hear a clear rationale for what were doing there and how we intend to achieve our goals, that they will be supportive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Though he and his advisers have drawn up benchmarks to measure progress and put pressure on the Afghan government to do its part, Mr. Obama offered no details in his public remarks on Tuesday. He was also silent on precisely what would constitute finishing the job in Afghanistan or how soon he envisioned being able to begin extricating the United States from the war there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 While the troop levels he orders will go a long way toward defining his position, the White House has stressed that Mr. Obamas review has gone far beyond the numbers to better define the military and civilian-aid components of the effort in Afghanistan, how they fit into efforts to combat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and how to ensure that the American commitment in the region is not open-ended.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 At the meeting on Monday night, Mr. Obama went around the table in the White House Situation Room asking his senior advisers for summations of their individual assessments and to voice any concerns they still had, said an administration official who was briefed on the two-hour meeting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 There was a lot of back and forth, said the official, with Mr. Obama interjecting questions and top aides cutting each other off at times. When the  meeting finished shortly after 10 p.m., some of the senior advisers lingered in small groups to continue their discussions, said the official, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the meetings confidentiality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The meeting covered a wide variety of issues, including benchmarks to measure progress by Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as the specific number of additional American troops to send.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Although his aides told some allies that the troop increase would most likely be slightly below 30,000  there are currently 68,000 American troops in Afghanistan  several officials said Mr. Obama did not appear completely settled on a final number.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Hes still not happy, one official said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 One reason for Mr. Obamas disquiet might be discontent among the members of his own party on Capitol Hill over the prospect of escalating the war and paying for it. Among those present at Monday nights session was
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/peter_orszag/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; peter=&quot;Peter&quot; orszag.=&quot;Orszag.&quot;&gt;
  Peter R. Orszag
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the White House budget director.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Before a meeting with Mr. Obama on Tuesday afternoon,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/nancy_pelosi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nancy=&quot;Nancy&quot; pelosi.=&quot;Pelosi.&quot;&gt;
  Nancy Pelosi
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the House speaker, said during a conference call of economists and bloggers that there was
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/world/asia/24policy.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  serious unrest in our caucus
 &lt;/a&gt;
 about can we afford this war.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Ms. Pelosi said she did not want to sacrifice the partys domestic agenda to the cost of the troop buildup. The American people believe that if something is in our national security interest, we have to be able to afford it, she said. That doesnt mean that we hold everything else hostage to that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Administration officials said that during the Monday meeting, officials discussed a proposal to deploy the American troops in waves, the first of which would go early next year to be in place in southern or eastern Afghanistan by spring. They said the American military should be able to deploy one brigade per quarter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 One administration official involved in Afghanistan policy said the president and his top advisers were thinking in terms of exit strategies and not necessarily exit timetables. He compared the current thinking to the conditional engagement that President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; george=&quot;George&quot; w.=&quot;W.&quot; bush.=&quot;Bush.&quot;&gt;
  George W. Bush
 &lt;/a&gt;
 used in Iraq.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 As Afghan security forces are trained and deployed, the official said, American officials and commanders would watch closely to determine when operational control of a given area could be turned over to them. That is what happened in Iraq, as American forces gradually turned over control of territory to Iraqis once they had proved their ability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 As you go along, you might have some target dates, the administration official said, noting as an example the proposal by Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/carl_levin/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; carl=&quot;Carl&quot; levin.=&quot;Levin.&quot;&gt;
  Carl Levin
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the Michigan Democrat who leads the Armed Services Committee, that by 2012, the Afghan Army should be increased to 240,000 soldiers from 92,000, and police forces to 160,000 officers from 84,000.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Obama declined to say what day he would make his announcement, but officials said the Congressional leadership had been invited to the White House for a briefing next Tuesday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Administration officials said that as part of his Afghanistan strategy, Mr. Obama would also announce
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/world/asia/20policy.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  strict benchmarks
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , or performance targets, which the United States will expect the Afghan government to meet. Mr. Obama will be tying both military and economic aid to Afghanistan to those targets, the officials said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 As the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/world/asia/23military.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  debate over the size of the troop increase
 &lt;/a&gt;
 has played out over the last few months, an increase of about 30,000 reinforcements has won the support of Defense Secretary

 &lt;/a&gt;
 .
&lt;/p&gt;

  Joseph R. Biden Jr.
 &lt;/a&gt;
 Mr. Obama will also be making a broader appeal for Afghanistans neighbors and regional actors to play a role, the officials said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 We have to do it as part of a broader international community, Mr. Obama said at the news conference. So one of the things Im going to be discussing is the obligations of our international partners in this process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 After Mr. Obama announces his Afghanistan strategy, Mrs. Clinton will brief
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/north_atlantic_treaty_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; north=&quot;North&quot; atlantic=&quot;Atlantic&quot; treaty=&quot;Treaty&quot; organization.=&quot;Organization.&quot;&gt;
  NATO
 &lt;/a&gt;
 allies at a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels on Dec. 3 and 4. There, Mrs. Clinton is expected to solicit specific contributions from them, including as many as 10,000 additional soldiers, bringing the total number of allied troops in line with General McChrystals request. Administration officials cautioned that they did not expect contributions to be nailed down until January.

 At two hearings on Capitol Hill, where they faced deep skepticism about different parts of Mr. Obamas war plan from both parties, they also said that the arrival of the additional forces, while speedy, would not be as fast as Mr. Obama suggested in

 Although most of the additional troops would arrive in Afghanistan in the first six months of next year, as the president announced, Adm.

  John P. Murtha
 &lt;/a&gt;
 of Pennsylvania, said Wednesday that he expected the White House to seek $40 billion by the spring to pay for the additional troops, or $10 billion more a year than the president estimated in his speech. Administration officials said they did not support efforts of some Democrats in Congress to pay for the additional troops with a surtax on incomes, meaning that war costs would continue to add to the deficit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In a full day of testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Gates, Mrs. Clinton and Admiral Mullen faced repeated criticism that the target date to begin withdrawals  less than a year after all the 30,000 troops arrive  would be an invitation to

  John McCain
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , Republican of Arizona, started the day by grilling Mr. Gates and Admiral Mullen, and said it made no sense to set an exit date if the withdrawal was also going to be based on conditions on the ground, as the president said in his speech.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Eight hours later on the House side, Mr. Gates was still answering the same question when he said: I have adamantly opposed deadlines. I opposed them in Iraq, and I oppose deadlines in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, he said, This will be a gradual process.
&lt;/p&gt;

  Stanley A. McChrystal
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , made the same point while speaking to reporters in Kabul, the Afghan capital. He said he was absolutely supportive of the timeline laid out by Mr. Obama, but he also cautioned that the timeline was flexible and is not an absolute.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Its not, At 18 months, everybody leaves, the general said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The July 2011 date, Mr. Gates, Mrs. Clinton and Admiral Mullen said, was in large part meant to be a wake-up call to the Afghans that the United States would not be in the country forever. How do you demonstrate resolve and at the same time convey a sense of urgency to the Afghans that they must step up to the plate and begin to take responsibility for their own security and to protect their own country against the extremists? Mr. Gates told the House committee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Although members of both parties expressed doubts about the war plan, there were few political fireworks. Representative
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/dana_rohrabacher/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; dana=&quot;Dana&quot; rohrabacher.=&quot;Rohrabacher.&quot;&gt;
  Dana Rohrabacher
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , a California Republican who opposes the war, dismissed Mr. Obamas strategy as maybe a different facade, but its the same old policy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Over all, the hearings had little of the drama that characterized Capitol Hill hearings on the war in Iraq. In the morning, Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/evan_bayh/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; evan=&quot;Evan&quot; bayh.=&quot;Bayh.&quot;&gt;
  Evan Bayh
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , Democrat of Indiana, offered his congratulations to Mrs. Clinton on the engagement of her daughter, Chelsea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The hearings did offer a glimpse of a few details and some of the thinking behind the presidents strategy. The testimony from the three officials showed that the White House would keep to its longstanding goal to build up the Afghan security forces to 240,000 by 2011, and not expand to 400,000 as General McChrystal had proposed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/carl_levin/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; carl=&quot;Carl&quot; levin.=&quot;Levin.&quot;&gt;
  Carl Levin
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the Michigan Democrat who has been a proponent of training more Afghan security forces, showed his own skepticism on that issue, and questioned whether sending so many additional troops might keep the Afghans from building up their security forces on their own. Where I have questions is whether the rapid deployment of a large number of U.S. combat forces, without an adequate number of Afghan security forces for our troops to partner with, serves that mission, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In his opening statement, Mr. Gates, who pushed for the 30,000 additional American troops and was singled out by the White House as influential in Mr. Obamas decision,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/us/politics/04military.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  sharply differed with some of Mr. Obamas advisers
 &lt;/a&gt;
 who have argued that the United States should focus on rooting out
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; al=&quot;Al&quot; qaeda.=&quot;Qaeda.&quot;&gt;
  Al Qaeda
 &lt;/a&gt;
 from Pakistan, and that the Taliban in Afghanistan do not present a serious long-term threat to the national security of the United States.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 On the contrary, Mr. Gates said, Al Qaeda and the Taliban are inextricably linked.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 While Al Qaeda is under great pressure now and dependent on the Taliban and other extremist groups for sustainment, the success of the Taliban would vastly strengthen Al Qaedas message, to the Muslim world, that violent extremists are on the winning side of history, Mr. Gates said. He added, The Taliban and Al Qaeda have become symbiotic, each benefiting from the success and mythology of the other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 When pressed by Senator
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/susan_collins/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; susan=&quot;Susan&quot; collins.=&quot;Collins.&quot;&gt;
  Susan Collins
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , Republican of Maine, on why the United States had to invest so much military power and money in Afghanistan when Al Qaeda still had the ability to establish havens in other countries, Mr. Gates replied that Afghanistan was unique.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Not only was it the place where the 2001 attacks against the United States were planned, he said, it is still the wellspring of inspiration for extremist jihadism everywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He said that the guidance and strategic leadership for Al Qaeda came from the groups leaders who were in the border area with Pakistan, and that there was an unholy alliance that had developed in the past year between Al Qaeda, the Taliban in Pakistan and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He added, If anything, the situation, I think, is more serious today than it was a year ago because of the attacks of the Taliban in Pakistan on Pakistan, and the effort of Al Qaeda in collusion with the Taliban in Pakistan to try and destabilize Pakistan itself.

  Vladimir V. Putin
 &lt;/a&gt;
 gave a speech on the dangers posed by spring flooding. The highest-ranking Russian official to address reporters about the treaty was Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, who hastily gathered the press at dinnertime in a tiny ministry conference room.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Lavrov called the agreement real progress in the relationship between Russia and the United States, but added that Russia could pull out if it concluded that the American missile defense plans had compromised its nuclear deterrent. Indeed, unease over missile defense was seeping into commentary even as officials hailed a mutual success.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mikhail V. Margelov, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of Russias Parliament, said the document was neither a Russian gift to America nor an American gift to Russia. He acknowledged that the reception had been quiet, saying that was because negotiators were focused on finishing the job.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 We are on the edge of signing a treaty, so why make noise? Mr. Margelov said. I mean, speaking in colloquial language, let us drink Champagne when we accomplish the task.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In recent months Russian leaders  notably Mr. Putin  have pushed openly for a pact that explicitly links reductions in strategic weapons to limits on the American missile-defense program. Aleksei K. Pushkov, the host of the political talk show Post-Scriptum, said he feared that the text of the treaty included only a soft linkage between offense and defense. For many Russians, the first question will be, Where have we made concessions to the United States? he said, and they will look for the answer in those phrases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The treaty will be criticized by a number of people  people who are connected to the military, and political experts who will say it is a fig leaf which allows Russia to save face, but does not allow Russia to ask anything of the U.S., at least anything of substance, Mr. Pushkov said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Should we have signed a treaty which does not give us any kind of serious guarantee? he said. This is something which will be debated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But if that conversation had begun on Friday, it was a quiet one. As Russias arsenal ages, the treaty will allow Moscow to maintain parity with the United States, which can afford a larger force, and arms talks serve to reassert its status as a nuclear superpower.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Gen. Nikolai Y. Makarov, the chief of Russias general staff, spoke in favor of the pact, saying it will eliminate concerns on both sides and is fully in line with the security interests of Russia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 One reason for Russian caution is the looming ratification vote in the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/senate/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; u.s.=&quot;U.S.&quot; senate.=&quot;Senate.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
  United States Senate
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , where any note of Russian triumphalism might play badly. Russias opposition is too weak to block ratification here, though Mr. Margelov said he expected vigorous criticism from Communists in Parliament, for whom, as he put it, any agreement with the United States is considered a kind of betrayal of the motherland.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He said he hoped they would all come to see the agreement for what it was: a compromise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 All foreign policy is compromise, he said. I dont think we have to report to our public that it was a great diplomatic victory for Russia. And our American colleagues should not deceive their public by saying it was a great American victory. It was a compromise. There is nothing wrong with that word.

   Gen. Ray Odierno, left, the commander in Iraq, says he is comfortable with the withdrawal plan.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The delay and messy aftermath of the Iraqi election mean it may be months before the next government is formed, even as tens of thousands of American troops pack to leave. Yet Mr. Obama has not had a meeting on Iraq with his full  national security team in months, and the White House insists that it has no plans to revisit the withdrawal timetable.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The situation presents a test for Mr. Obamas vow to end the  war, perhaps the most defining promise he made when he ran for president. While Mr. Obama has proved flexible about other campaign promises and deadlines, his plan to pull out combat forces by August and the remaining 50,000 trainers and advisers by December 2011 has been the most inviolate of policies.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  By sticking to the deadline, Mr. Obama effectively is abandoning the thesis he adopted on the recommendation of military and civilian advisers in February 2009 that a large American military presence was needed long enough to provide stability during the post-election transition.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Instead, the president is now relying on the conclusion that Iraqis are stepping up to the challenges of governing and security that for too long depended on Americans.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We see no indications now that our planning needs to be adjusted, said Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama. We did anticipate an extended period of government formation, and recent Iraqi-led missions that have
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/world/middleeast/20baghdad.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
   killed leaders of Al Qaeda in Iraq
  &lt;/a&gt;
  show their growing capacity to provide for security, which of course is critical to ending our combat mission at the end of August.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While Mr. Obama has not convened a full-scale meeting on Iraq lately, Mr. Rhodes noted that  Vice President
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/joseph_r_jr_biden/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; joseph=&quot;Joseph&quot; r.=&quot;R.&quot; biden=&quot;Biden&quot; jr.=&quot;Jr.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Joseph R. Biden Jr.
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , who manages Iraq policy, does hold such meetings regularly and keeps Mr. Obama informed.  Its something that hes obviously regularly engaged in, Mr. Rhodes said of the president.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For Mr. Obama, shifting the deadline would prove complicated for both logistical and political reasons. As he pulls troops out of Iraq, he has been sending more to Afghanistan, putting pressure on the armed forces. And with his liberal base angry at the Afghan troop buildup, any delay of the Iraq drawdown could provoke more consternation on the left.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But the resistance to revisiting the deadline has drawn concern from former American officials, including some who participated in formulating the Obama policy last year. The original plan anticipated Iraqi elections in December and the formation of a new government at least 60 days afterward. Instead, the elections did not take place until March and produced a near tie between the parties of Prime Minister
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/nuri_kamal_al-maliki/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nuri=&quot;Nuri&quot; kamal=&quot;Kamal&quot; al-maliki.=&quot;al-Maliki.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;

   Texas AThe elections were later than expected and there were very close results between Maliki and Allawi, which suggest its going to be a very long process. We may not even have a new government until were at the August deadline. Id like the U.S. to retain the original flexibility.
  &lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meghan L. OSullivan, a former deputy national security adviser to Mr. Bush who oversaw Iraq policy, also said August might be too soon.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Im for a shift away from the current rigid deadline to something more flexible, more reflective of the fluid and tense situation in Iraq, where the last thing the Iraqis really need is for the United States to be focused more on exit than anything else at a moment of high political uncertainty, she said.

  Two former officials who worked on Iraq policy in the Obama administration said that after it became clear how late the elections would be, Gen.

   Ray Odierno
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , the commander in Iraq, wanted to keep  3,000 to 5,000 combat troops in northern Iraq after the Aug. 31 deadline. But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter, said it was clear that the White House did not want any combat units to remain.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Brig. Gen. Stephen R. Lanza, a spokesman for General Odierno, said no formal request to the White House was ever made. Nor, he added, has the president ever denied him the tools needed to complete our mission.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  At Mr. Obamas invitation, President
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/dmitri_a_medvedev/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; dmitri=&quot;Dmitri&quot; a.=&quot;A.&quot; medvedev.=&quot;Medvedev.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Dmitri A. Medvedev
  &lt;/a&gt;
  traveled to the United States on Tuesday, stopping first in California to woo Silicon Valley technology companies to help build his own Russian center of innovation. On Thursday, the two presidents will meet at the White House to discuss expanding trade and investment.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The focus on economic cooperation is intended to take the relationship between the two countries to a new level after years of mutual suspicion that peaked in 2008 during Russias war with Georgia, its small neighbor to the south. We want to develop a multidimensional relationship with Russia, said Michael McFaul, Mr. Obamas top Russia adviser. This trip will build on the foundation of these core security interests.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If Mr. Obama can open up economic avenues, that could further the emerging partnership. I think of those mutually beneficial economic ties as ballast that could keep the overall relationship on an even keel even when adverse political winds threaten to blow us off course, said Edward S. Verona, president of
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usrbc.org/&quot; title=&quot;The&quot; councils=&quot;councils&quot; web=&quot;Web&quot; site=&quot;site&quot;&gt;
   the U.S.-Russia Business Council
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Obama has already revived a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement that could be lucrative to Russia, and he will have what Mr. McFaul called a pretty serious discussion with Mr. Medvedev about how to secure Russian membership in the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_trade_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; world=&quot;World&quot; trade=&quot;Trade&quot; organization.=&quot;Organization.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   World Trade Organization
  &lt;/a&gt;
  after 17 years of talks. Russia is by far the largest economy outside the 153-nation organization, which sets rules for international trade, and Mr. Medvedev expressed frustration that we have been led around by the nose for a long time, as he told The Wall Street Journal last week.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  An agreement between the two presidents on Russias W.T.O. accession could take away the remaining hurdles, said Anders Aslund, a Russia specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. It would be a game changer for Russias domestic development, rendering the economy more open and competitive, while integrating Russia more firmly in the international community.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But expanding economic relations may prove harder than negotiating an arms treaty. Since the end of the cold war, every American president has talked about forging closer trade and investment ties with Russia, but with limited success. The United States did only $24 billion in trade with Russia last year  double the figure of just a few years ago, but still less than trade with Brazil, Taiwan or South Korea and a small fraction of the $366 billion in trade with China last year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  One reason is the lack of a genuine rule of law in Russia. Foreign companies and investors have found themselves subject to capricious or even corrupt decisions by the Russian government and politically connected moguls with little real recourse in a judicial system that still defers to the Kremlin or local authorities.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Take the cases of three men as examples:
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/mikhail_b_khodorkovsky/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; mikhail=&quot;Mikhail&quot; b.=&quot;B.&quot; khodorkovsky.=&quot;Khodorkovsky.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , once Russias richest man and its most successful capitalist, was in talks to sell a stake in his
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/oil_spills/gulf_of_mexico_2010/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; oil=&quot;oil&quot; spills.=&quot;spills.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   oil
  &lt;/a&gt;
  company to Exxon Mobil or ChevronTexaco when he was arrested in a political dispute with the Kremlin in 2003. He has been behind bars ever since and is on trial again in Moscow on what independent analysts consider trumped-up charges.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  William F. Browder, once the largest foreign portfolio investor in Moscow, was denied entry to the country in 2005 and had his companies used in what he says was a huge fraud scheme. A lawyer he had hired, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested and died in prison last year when the authorities withheld medical treatment.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Robert Dudley was chief executive of BPs joint venture with Russian oil moguls, called
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/tnk_bp/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; tnk-bp.=&quot;TNK-BP.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   TNK-BP
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , until a fight over control of the company led to problems renewing his visa and ultimately forced him out of the country in 2008. He is now managing BPs response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Browder is now waging a campaign warning American businesses away from Russia, briefing corporate lawyers for companies that Mr. Medvedev will visit and the staffs of several California lawmakers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Medvedev is on a trip to attract U.S. technology companies to come to Russia and saying many nice things about the rule of law and modernization, when, in fact, the difference between his words and reality could not be more stark, Mr. Browder said. My advice to U.S. technology companies is to steer clear of Russia because its insanity to go there. They not only will risk their money, but also the lives of their employees.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Others argue that American investment only props up the current authoritarian system.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Western capital helps to support the status quo, said Lilia Shevtsova, an analyst at
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carnegie.ru/?lang=en&quot; title=&quot;The&quot; centers=&quot;centers&quot; web=&quot;Web&quot; site=&quot;site&quot;&gt;
   the Carnegie Moscow Center
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . It injects financial and technological

   Viagra
  &lt;/a&gt;
  to the existing system. Western capital could become an engine of modernization only under new rules of the game  that is, when Russia moves toward real competition and rule of law.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Toby Gati, a strategic adviser to companies working in Russia, was more optimistic. We have the beginnings of a new mind-set on both sides, with the Russians now developing a stake in working with the U.S. for mainly economic reasons, said Ms. Gati, who works for the law firm Akin Gump.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But to make it work, she said, Moscow needs to guarantee property rights and rule of law: These are things Medvedev has spoken about, to his credit, she said, but so far he has done little to make them happen.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Medvedev is arguing that Russia is open for business. He met with American business leaders in St. Petersburg last week and agreed to have dinner in San Francisco on Tuesday night with Silicon Valley pioneers invited by former Secretary of State
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/george_p_shultz/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; george=&quot;George&quot; p.=&quot;P.&quot; shultz.=&quot;Shultz.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   George P. Shultz
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . On Wednesday, he will visit Silicon Valley to draw investment and inspiration for a Russian version in the Moscow suburb of Skolkovo.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Among the supporters of his initiative is
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/eric_e_schmidt/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; eric=&quot;Eric&quot; e.=&quot;E.&quot; schmidt.=&quot;Schmidt.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Eric E. Schmidt
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , chief executive of Google, who said he thought greater technology cooperation would force changes in Russias business environment.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  My personal view, Mr. Schmidt said in an e-mail message, is that the presence of such technical companies, especially with foreign partnerships, are a great way to get the openness, transparency and societal change needed for the Russians to continue their development into a modern first-world government. Their presence in Russia will help pressure the incumbents who fear change and will also clearly benefit the citizens over all.

  &lt;/a&gt;
  s White House visit, frustrated Mr. Obamas team. But as prosecutors assemble their case, Mr. Obama has resolved not to let the ghosts of the 20th century get in the way of his goals in the 21st.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Obamas administration said Wednesday that it would not expel Russian diplomats and it expressed no indignation that its putative partner was spying on it. Mr. Obamas plan is to largely ignore the issue publicly, leaving it to diplomats and investigators to handle, while he moves on to what he sees as more important matters.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We would like to get to the point where there is just so much trust and cooperation between the United States and
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/russiaandtheformersovietunion/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; russia=&quot;Russia&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; post-soviet=&quot;Post-Soviet&quot; nations.=&quot;Nations.&quot; class=&quot;meta-loc&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  that nobody would think of turning to intelligence means to find out things that they couldnt find out in other channels, Philip Gordon, the assistant secretary of state in charge of Russia, told reporters. Were apparently not there yet. I dont think anyone in this room is shocked to have discovered that.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But the spy scandal could embolden critics who argue that Mr. Obama has been overly optimistic about his capacity to reset a relationship freighted by longstanding suspicion and clashing interests. The episode could complicate Mr. Obamas efforts to persuade the Senate to approve the new arms control treaty he negotiated with Mr. Medvedev.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It ought to reset our rosy view of Russia and remind us that Russia is not a trustworthy ally, Senator
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/christopher_s_bond/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; christopher=&quot;Christopher&quot; s.=&quot;S.&quot; bond.=&quot;Bond.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, said in an interview. Harking back to
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/ronald_wilson_reagan/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; ronald=&quot;Ronald&quot; wilson=&quot;Wilson&quot; reagan.=&quot;Reagan.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Ronald Reagan
  &lt;/a&gt;
  s approach, Mr. Bond said: We have to deal with them. But wasnt there a great president who said, Trust but verify?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Even if Mr. Obama can assuage doubts on the treaty, the scandal has underscored the limits of the new relationship.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The spy scandal is unlikely to derail the reset because both sides have too much invested in the success of the current agenda, said Angela E. Stent, a former National Intelligence Council official now at
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/georgetown_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; georgetown=&quot;Georgetown&quot; university=&quot;University&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   Georgetown University
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . But it is a cautionary reminder that the U.S.-Russian relationship remains a selective partnership where cold war legacies persist.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Part of the problem for Mr. Obama is that his desire to redefine the relationship has been misinterpreted as an effort to redefine Russia itself, said

  , a scholar at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization close to the White House. Its a reminder that yes, Russia is still Russia and Putin is still Putin, he said of the spy case, referring to Prime Minister
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/vladimir_v_putin/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; vladimir=&quot;Vladimir&quot; v.=&quot;V.&quot; putin.=&quot;Putin.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Vladimir V. Putin
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , a former K.G.B. colonel. None of that is Obamas fault. The intention was never to reset Russia.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It should come as little surprise, of course, that the two countries still spy on each other two decades after the end of the cold war. Even close allies like Israel have been caught spying here. Recent history shows that Washington and Moscow have been able to get past such moments when they were determined to pursue other agendas.
 &lt;/p&gt;

  This case should be easier to overcome without tit-for-tat expulsions because the suspected spy ring did not seem to achieve any serious breach of national security. As

 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Russian leaders appear interested in playing down the situation. Although Moscow initially called the charges baseless, the Foreign Ministry later took that statement off its Web site and confirmed that the suspects were Russian citizens. Mr. Putin said the American authorities had gotten out of control in making the arrests, but then minimized it by saying relations will not suffer. Much of the Russian commentary suggested that the arrests were an effort by dark forces in the American government to undermine Mr. Obamas reset policy.

  Suspect Disappears in Cyprus
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  ATHENS  The 11th suspect in the  Russian spy ring case   has disappeared on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, where he was arrested but released on bail Tuesday.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Late Wednesday, a police spokesman told the Cyprus state news agency that the suspect, Christopher Metsos, 54, had failed to report as required to a precinct in the islands southwest, where he had been apprehended. The police obtained a warrant for his arrest and a manhunt was under way.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Metsos, who is accused of being the spy rings paymaster, was arrested early Tuesday at the airport in the southern city of Larnaca as he was about to fly to Budapest.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In a move that dismayed American law enforcement authorities, a local court ordered his release on bail of around $25,000 on the condition that he surrender his passport while arrangements were made for his extradition to the United States.

 &lt;p&gt;
  As a candidate for president, I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end, Mr. Obama told a convention of Disabled American Veterans in Atlanta on Monday. Shortly after taking office, I announced our new strategy for Iraq and for a transition to full Iraqi responsibility. And I made it clear that by August 31, 2010, Americas combat mission in Iraq would end. And that is exactly what we are doing  as promised and on schedule.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  By the end of this month,  the American force in Iraq will have shrunk to just 50,000 troops, from 144,000. The remaining advise and assist brigades will officially focus on supporting and training Iraqi security forces, protecting American personnel and facilities and mounting counterterrorism operations. Those 50,000 troops are due to leave by the end of 2011.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Obamas  appearance before the veterans group is the first of  several similar events in coming weeks meant to draw attention to the transition in Iraq. While he has gone months without mentioning the war much in public as he focused on tightening regulation of the financial industry and stopping the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/oil_spills/gulf_of_mexico_2010/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; oil=&quot;oil&quot; spills.=&quot;spills.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   oil spill
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in the Gulf of Mexico, the president is now trying to remind Americans of one of his most important decisions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The high-level public focus on Iraq appears aimed at least in part at blunting some of the growing frustration, particularly among his liberal base, over the war in Afghanistan. The president essentially is arguing to skeptics in the public and in Congress that he is bringing at least one war to a conclusion and can do so with another eventually as well.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  A fact sheet prepared by the White House, for instance, pointedly notes that even with his troop buildup in Afghanistan, the drawdown in Iraq means that the total number of uniformed Americans in the two countries will have dropped from 177,000 when he took office to about 146,000 by the end of August.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But with the Afghan conflict now the longest-running war in American history and casualties rising in July to their highest level since it began nearly nine years ago, Mr. Obama may have difficulty offsetting the growing anxiety about one war by claiming success in another. In the House, 102 Democrats voted last week against a $59 billion spending bill to pay for the two wars, 70 more than the number who voted against a similar measure last year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The replacement of the commanding general in Afghanistan and the publication by
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/wikileaks/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; wikileaks.=&quot;WikiLeaks.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   WikiLeaks
  &lt;/a&gt;
  of tens of thousands of secret United States military reports have focused attention on the struggles in turning around the war. The number of troops in Afghanistan has tripled since Mr. Obama took office,  but he has ordered that some of them begin pulling out by July 2011.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The tension over that deadline was evident on a talk show on Sunday, when the House speaker,
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/nancy_pelosi/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nancy=&quot;Nancy&quot; pelosi.=&quot;Pelosi.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;

   Robert M. Gates
  &lt;/a&gt;
  outlined starkly different ideas of what they hope or anticipate will happen next summer. Just last month, Vice President
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/joseph_r_jr_biden/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; joseph=&quot;Joseph&quot; r.=&quot;R.&quot; biden=&quot;Biden&quot; jr.=&quot;Jr.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Joseph R. Biden Jr.
  &lt;/a&gt;
  played down the July 2011 start of a withdrawal, saying it could mean pulling out as few as a couple thousand troops.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Ms. Pelosi made clear she found that unsatisfactory. I hope it is more than that, she said on This Week on ABC. I know its not going to be turn out the lights and lets all go home on one day. But I do think the American people expect it to be somewhere between that and a few thousand troops.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But Mr. Gates, appearing on the same program, said he hopes to limit any troop pullout at first. My personal opinion is that drawdowns early on will be of fairly limited numbers, he said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Obama made no reference on Monday to the withdrawal deadline before the veterans group, where it might not be as popular as it is with his supporters, but instead vowed to continue pursuing radicals in Afghanistan, noting that
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; al=&quot;Al&quot; qaeda.=&quot;Qaeda.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   Al Qaeda
  &lt;/a&gt;
  plotted the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, from there.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If Afghanistan were to be engulfed by an even wider insurgency, Al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates would have even more space to plan their next attack, he said. And as president of the United States, I refuse to let that happen.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But Mr. Obama argued that his strategy in Afghanistan was beginning to show results.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Its important that the American people know that we are making progress and we are focused on goals that are clear and achievable, he said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  With Iraq, Mr. Obama has stuck to his withdrawal schedule despite changing conditions on the ground. He promised during the campaign to pull out combat forces within 16 months. But after taking office he extended that to 19 months to give the Iraqis enough time to hold a new election, assemble a fresh government and get through a transition with the security of a robust American force.

  As columns of vehicles crossed the border and troops arrived to happy homecomings last week, Mr. Obama released a restrained written statement and made a one-sentence reference at a pair of fund-raisers. While some called it the end of the seven-year war, Mr. Obama sought to avoid the sort of

   mission accomplished moment
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that haunted his predecessor.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But the White House wants to find a way to mark the moment and remind voters just two months before midterm elections that he delivered on his vow to pull out combat forces. Mr. Obama plans to make a high-profile speech on the drawdown next week, and aides are discussing whether to have him meet with returning troops. Vice President
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/joseph_r_jr_biden/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; joseph=&quot;Joseph&quot; r.=&quot;R.&quot; biden=&quot;Biden&quot; jr.=&quot;Jr.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  The symbolism of the departing troops that played out on network television masked the more complex reality on the ground. Even as the last designated combat forces leave and the mission formally changes on Aug. 31 to a support role, 50,000 American advise and assist troops will remain in the country for 16 months more, still in harms way and still armed for combat if necessary. Whats more, Iraqs future remains fraught with challenges amid a stubborn political impasse and a continuing low-grade insurgency.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Political posturing is the norm in Washington, and claiming victory and an end to a war is far more popular than bearing the burden of leadership and dealing with reality,

  Does anybody believe the violence is going to stop entirely and the opponents to stability and progress in Iraq are going to stand down? No, he said. But we do know that the Iraqi security forces are in a position to take that role on themselves increasingly.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The official transition from Operation Iraqi Freedom to Operation New Dawn is as much a change in labels as it is a change in mission. With violence far below its peak in 2006 and 2007, American forces have increasingly taken a back seat to the Iraqi security units they trained.

   George W. Bush
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on the basis of false intelligence, the desire for finality, and perhaps closure, has focused attention on this moment and provoked a fresh discussion in Washington about what it all has meant.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  After hundreds of billions of dollars, more than 4,400 American military deaths and at least 100,000 Iraqi civilian deaths and perhaps many more, was it worth it? Did toppling a dictator and nursing a fledgling if flawed democracy make a difference? And did the United States salvage credibility by sticking it out and finally stabilizing Iraq even if not winning the clear-cut victory originally envisioned?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If we cant have a victory parade, we at least ought to be able to make some definitive conclusions, said

   Washington Rules: Americas Path to Permanent War.

  &lt;/a&gt;
  And it just doesnt seem that we are going to do so. We want to just move on, sadly.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In part, that owes to the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, where Mr. Obama is sending more troops, as well as the fragile economy at home, where millions of Americans are looking for work. And so while his opposition to the Iraq war animated his early candidacy, it seems almost a secondary issue these days.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  During a fund-raising speech in Ohio last week, for instance, Mr. Obama mentioned the Iraq transition only in passing. We are keeping the promise I made when I began my campaign for the presidency: by the end of this month, we will have removed 100,000 troops from Iraq, and our combat mission will be over in Iraq, he said, a line he later repeated at a fund-raiser in Miami.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As they mark the moment, Democrats generally make no mention of the troop buildup and strategy change ordered by Mr. Bush in 2007, which many credit with turning around the war and making it possible to end combat now. By the time Mr. Bush left office, he had sealed an agreement with Iraq to withdraw all American troops by the end of 2011. After taking office, Mr. Obama added an intermediary deadline of drawing down to 50,000 by the end of this month.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Bush showed up unannounced at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport earlier this month to greet troops returning from Iraq. While no news media were invited,

   L. Paul Bremer III
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , the former Iraqi occupation administrator, said in an interview. Its not a complete success yet, obviously, but building democracy takes time.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  He added that a successful Arab-Muslim democracy basically puts the lie to the Islamic extremists who maintain that democracy is anathema to Islam and advocate a harsh form of rule.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;

   Stephen J. Hadley
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , who was Mr. Bushs national security adviser, said the current transition was due to the surge ordered by the former president and opposed by Mr. Obama when he was a senator. But he said he was glad that Mr. Obamas team has gone through a transition and that it seemed to be taking pride in accomplishments in Iraq. He said he hoped that the administration would see the task through.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If they do, they can rightly claim some measure of credit, and I would be the first to give them credit, Mr. Hadley said. But they need to stay focused and stay engaged.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For Mr. Obama, this moment is a reminder of the lesson his predecessor learned after
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/02/world/aftereffects-the-president-bush-declares-one-victory-in-a-war-on-terror.html?&quot; title=&quot;New&quot; york=&quot;York&quot; times=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
   declaring the end of major combat
  &lt;/a&gt;
  operations on an aircraft carrier in front of a Mission Accomplished banner in 2003. Iraq was a messy war with no tidy end. There will be no surrender ceremony on the deck of a battleship, Mr. Bush later concluded.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Obama has come to the same realization, in almost the exact same words.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  There will be no simple moment of surrender to mark the journeys end, he declared last spring.

 &lt;p&gt;
  Speaking just hours before he is to deliver an Oval Office address commemorating what is supposed to be the end of combat in Iraq, where some 50,000 troops will remain until next year in a mainly advisory and training role, Mr. Obama nonetheless warned that the American mission is not yet accomplished. Mr. Obama told the troops that his Oval Office address is not going to be a victory lap; its not going to be self-congratulatory. Theres still a lot of work.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Obamas address tonight is meant to convey that he has kept one of the central promises of his campaign: withdrawing American combat troops from Iraq. But he is tiptoeing a fine line between taking credit for the withdrawal and echoing the mission accomplished tone that President Bush struck so famously seven years ago, and that came back to haunt Mr. Bush in the ensuing years as Iraq fell into further chaos.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Obama called Mr. Bush Tuesday morning from
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/presidents_and_presidency_us/air_force_one/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; air=&quot;Air&quot; force=&quot;Force&quot; one.=&quot;One.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   Air Force One
  &lt;/a&gt;
  as he was enroute to Fort Bliss, White House officials said. The two spoke just for a few moments, Benjamin Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters aboard the plane, declining to give any additional detail about the conversation.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In rolling out the promises-kept theme on the Iraq withdrawal, Mr. Obama is trying to reconcile his record of opposition to the war, and to the troop surge ordered by President Bush which many military officials credit for stemming violence in Iraq, with his role as a war-time commander seeking to credit his troops with a mission accomplished.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While there were big debates about war and peace across the country, the president said, the one thing we dont argue about is that we have the finest fighting force in the history of the world. He got shouts of approval from the assembled Fort Bliss troops for that line. (The event was covered by a small pool of print and television reporters.)
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The main message I have tonight and the main message I have to you is congratulations on a job well done, Mr. Obama said. The most pride I take in my job is being your commander in chief.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On Afghanistan, Mr. Obama said that he is convinced that under the command of General
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/david_h_petraeus/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; david=&quot;David&quot; h.=&quot;H.&quot; petraeus.=&quot;Petraeus.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   David Petraeus
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , the latest American military commander in Afghanistan, we have the troops who are there in a position to start taking the fight to the terrorists. But he warned that there would be heavy casualties.Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/robert_m_gates/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; robert=&quot;Robert&quot; m.=&quot;M.&quot; gates.=&quot;Gates.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Robert M. Gates
  &lt;/a&gt;
  warned against premature victory parades or self-congratulations as American combat operations in Iraq drew officially to a close, and at the same time said that the success of United States forces in Afghanistan was only possible, not inevitable
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In remarks to the American Legion in Milwaukee, Mr. Gates sounded a restrained, sober note about the state of Americas two wars.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In Iraq, he said, the most recent elections have yet to result in a coalition government,
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda_in_mesopotamia/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; al=&quot;Al&quot; qaeda=&quot;Qaeda&quot; in=&quot;in&quot; mesopotamia.=&quot;Mesopotamia.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia
  &lt;/a&gt;
  is beaten but not gone, and sectarian tensions remain. He said the 50,000 United States troops still in Iraq would continue to work with Iraqi security forces, who only last week faced a flurry of coordinated insurgent attacks across the country that killed at least 51 people.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I am not saying that all is, or necessarily will be, well in Iraq, Mr. Gates, who is one of Mr. Obamas most influential advisers, told the legion.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In Afghanistan, he said, the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/taliban/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; taliban.=&quot;Taliban.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   Taliban
  &lt;/a&gt;
  are a cruel and ruthless adversary, and are not going quietly. Their leadership, he said, has ordered a campaign of intimidation against Afghan civilians and is singling out women for brutal attacks.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I know there is a good deal of concern and impatience about the pace of progress since the new strategy was announced last December, Mr. Gates said, referring to Mr. Obamas decision to send to Afghanistan 30,000 additional United States troops, who have finished arriving only this month. Total American forces in Afghanistan now number nearly 100,000.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But in an attempt to draw a parallel between the current fragile stability of Iraq and what might be possible in Afghanistan, Mr. Gates said that the intensifying combat and rising casualties in Afghanistan were in many ways reminiscent of the early months of the surge of United States forces ordered in Iraq by President
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; george=&quot;George&quot; w.=&quot;W.&quot; bush.=&quot;Bush.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   George W. Bush
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in 2007, when American troops were taking the highest losses of the war.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Three and a half years ago very few believed the surge could take us to where we are today in Iraq, and there were plenty of reasons for doubts, said Mr. Gates, who helped make the surge decision as Mr. Bushs defense secretary at the time. But back then, this countrys civilian and military leadership chose the path we believed had the best chance of achieving our national security objectives, as we are doing in Afghanistan today.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  He added: Success there is not inevitable. But with the right strategy and the willingness to see it through, it is possible. And it is certainly worth the fight.
