 BERLIN  Blaming a drastic slump in exports, the German government on Wednesday predicted a 6 percent contraction in its economy this year, and warned that other countries in the euro zone may not be able to stay competitive as the downturn drags on.

    Germanys finance minister, Peer Steinbrck, left, and the economy minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, met before a cabinet meeting in Berlin Wednesday to discuss the economy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;secondParagraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Peer Steinbrck, the German finance minister, said that with more than 40 percent of its gross domestic product  generated by exports, Germany would suffer a severe contraction this year from the worst recession since the Second World War.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Speaking in Berlin, Mr. Steinbrck said that the German economy was still well placed to weather the storm because of structural changes and investments in its infrastructure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But he suggested that other countries would be less able to deal with the fallout from the financial crisis, and that would sharpen disparities among the 16 nations that use the euro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 We are worried about other countries losing their competitiveness within the euro zone, Mr. Steinbrck said. This is likely to have negative results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In recent months, worries have grown in particular over the economic position of Italy and Greece.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In March, the commissions quarterly report on the euro zone noted that competitiveness imbalances have built up within the euro area, increasing the exposure of some member states to the financial turmoil.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Three months ago, the German government was forecasting that G.D.P. would contract by 2.25 percent in 2009. But since then, Berlin has suffered from plummeting demand for its products as its foreign customers rein in spending.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The revision announced Wednesday brings the German government more closely into line with independent forecasts on G.D.P. Forecasts from the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_monetary_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; international=&quot;International&quot; monetary=&quot;Monetary&quot; fund.=&quot;Fund.&quot;&gt;
  International Monetary Fund
 &lt;/a&gt;
 last week suggested a German G.D.P. decline of 5.6 percent this year, worse than that of any other advanced economy except Japans, which the I.M.F. predicted would shrink by 6.2 percent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The coalition government of Chancellor

  Angela Merkel
 &lt;/a&gt;
 has recently announced  two successive stimulus packages worth an estimated 81 billion euros to respond to the financial and economic crisis. But policy makers in Berlin have played down  the prospect of another package of measures to shore up the domestic economy.

  Afghanistan
 &lt;/a&gt;
 thrust Berlins role in the escalating conflict onto front pages nationwide and back to the forefront of political discourse here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Afghanistan is not likely to top the agenda when Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Obama meet at the White House on Friday. Advisers said Wednesday in Berlin that the talks would focus on the environment, the crisis in Iran and the global economy, among a host of other issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But the Afghanistan mission, and disappointment in Washington over allies unwillingness to shoulder more of the burden, is central to the future of the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/north_atlantic_treaty_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; north=&quot;North&quot; atlantic=&quot;Atlantic&quot; treaty=&quot;Treaty&quot; organization.=&quot;Organization.&quot;&gt;
  NATO
 &lt;/a&gt;
 military alliance, the institution that more than any other binds Europe and the United States. And it is likely to dog Mrs. Merkel as she leads her Christian Democratic Union into parliamentary elections in September.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 On Tuesday, during a skirmish with insurgents, a German armored personnel carrier flipped over into a water-filled ditch. Four of the seven soldiers inside managed to escape, but with rescue efforts impeded by heavy fire, three men in their early 20s died.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The Germans have long been criticized by NATO allies for limiting their troop deployment in Afghanistan and in particular for not sending more soldiers to the southern part of the country where the heaviest fighting has taken place. But now German units are reporting that the fight is coming to them, with better organized attacks on their personnel and much fiercer clashes in their own areas of operation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Including the latest fatalities, 35 German soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan, and 3,770 remain stationed there. Just last week the German cabinet agreed to expand the force by up to 300, as part of a deployment of surveillance aircraft, despite the unpopularity of the mission with the German public.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But if the military action heats up, and bodies continue to arrive back in
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/germany/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; germany.=&quot;Germany.&quot;&gt;
  Germany
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the pressure to cut down on the deployment will become intense, many experts say.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 If things get rough in Afghanistan, and I cant believe they wont, youre going to see real questioning about Germany, what kind of ally they are, said

 &lt;/a&gt;
 . Yet Mr. Hunter added that, given Germanys pacifist reaction to its Nazi past, the countrys armed presence in Afghanistan represented progress, if not enough to satisfy critics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 They have, one step at a time, been getting their feet wet more, Mr. Hunter said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The deep unease over military engagement can be seen in the political bickering that has broken out in recent days here over
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,632535,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Spiegel&quot; article=&quot;article&quot; on=&quot;on&quot; controversy=&quot;controversy&quot;&gt;
  whether to use the word war
 &lt;/a&gt;
 to describe the conditions in Afghanistan. Defense Minister Franz Josef Jung told German radio, If we speak of war, then we are only concentrating on the military aspect in the region, and that is a mistake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Jungs comments provoked sharp disagreement. For me, what is decisive is what the soldiers tell me, said Reinhold Robbe, the German Parliaments military commissioner, who had just visited troops in Afghanistan the week before. They say, Right now we arent digging any wells and we arent dedicating any schools. At the moment we are in a war.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A leading newspaper,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/&quot; title=&quot;Newspaper&quot; web=&quot;Web&quot; site=&quot;site&quot;&gt;
  Sddeutsche Zeitung
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , on Thursday called the debate over whether to call the conflict a war an aggravating semantic farce, and many here agree. But it also reveals the contradictory impulses in a society traumatized by two world wars and ashamed of its role in them, but also trying to act as a responsible ally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 As a result, the effort more often seems to be portrayed in Germany as a peacekeeping mission or civil aid delivered by soldiers. We have no leading politicians who can credibly and convincingly convey to the population why they should support the Afghanistan mission, said Winfried Nachtwei, a security expert in Parliament for the opposition Green Party. The chancellor only handles the subject with great caution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 With parliamentary elections coming up in September, Mrs. Merkel is under significant pressure on a number of issues. Like much of the rest of the world, Germany finds itself in the midst of a deep
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; recession.=&quot;recession.&quot;&gt;
  recession
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , but one made even more intense because of its economys heavy reliance on exports as world trade has shriveled.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A draft budget approved by the German cabinet this week lists a 2010 deficit that could top $140 billion, a record for a country that is deeply wary of debt. That is equal to as much as 6 percent of Germanys
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/u/united_states_economy/gross_domestic_product/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; u.s.=&quot;U.S.&quot; gross=&quot;gross&quot; domestic=&quot;domestic&quot; product.=&quot;product.&quot;&gt;
  gross domestic product
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , compared with a deficit of almost 13  percent of G.D.P. that the United States is expected to run in 2009.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The trip to Washington is meant to put to rest widespread talk of tensions between Germany and the United States and a lack of chemistry between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Merkel, who
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/world/europe/06prexy.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  dismissed talk of strains in their relationship
 &lt;/a&gt;
 at a news conference in Dresden this month. Mr. Obama is extraordinarily popular in Germany, and Mrs. Merkel can ill afford a rift. The two leaders expect to make a joint appearance in the Rose Garden of the White House that could be a help for the chancellor before the election.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Afghanistan had receded from public attention somewhat with election protests in Iran, but with increasing violence and the presidential election coming up in Afghanistan, it will not stay that way for long.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 What I would do if I were a German is I would step up to the plate in a major way in the nonmilitary aid, said Mr. Hunter of  RAND. If I were Merkel, I would come to town, say, Im doing governance, reconstruction and development, and Im doing it in a big way. It not only contributes to the reality of the conflict, but also will buy a lot of credit.

     Turnout Seen as Uneven in Afghanistan Election
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (August 21, 2009)
   &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;secondParagraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In doing so, the party has broken ranks with most of the major parties, which have tried to keep the issue of
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/germany/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; germany.=&quot;Germany.&quot;&gt;
  Germany
 &lt;/a&gt;
 s controversial Afghan presence out of the public eye.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The next government must formulate a precise plan that spells out how a pull-out of the German Army over the coming years would look, Jrgen Koppelin, a federal legislator and defense expert for the Free Democrats, said in a newspaper interview Wednesday. Our soldiers in Afghanistan and their families need to know that the mission will end.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 By raising the issue now, the Free Democrats may be trying to show their foreign policy credentials, particularly since they hope to take over the Foreign Ministry if they win enough votes to form the next coalition with Mrs. Merkel, who is favored to retain the chancellery. So far, foreign policy issues have played no role in this campaign, which has yet to get going in force.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The Free Democrats have also tapped into the public mood, which may win them more votes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 According to opinion polls, the majority of those asked say they are opposed to German soldiers remaining in Afghanistan. That view reflects the anti-war attitude that has been ingrained in the populace since 1945.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkel and her governing partner, the Social Democrats, have not engaged the Afghan issue in any substantive way during the campaign, hoping to avoid having it become the topic of an incendiary debate that could significantly affect the voting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Only the opposition Left Party, a relatively new grouping of former East German communists and West German trade unionists, has been consistently outspoken about Afghanistan, demanding the immediate end of the mission. But it is viewed as a strident voice on the subject, and its calls have been ignored by the government and other opposition parties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Internationally, Germany has been the target of much criticism from its NATO allies  particularly Britain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States   whose troops have borne the brunt of the fighting in southern Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 German troops are based in the northern province of Kunduz, which had been relatively peaceful until the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/taliban/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; taliban.=&quot;Taliban.&quot;&gt;
  Taliban
 &lt;/a&gt;
 established a foothold there. The government in Berlin has refused to send any troops to join NATO and U.S. forces in the south on the grounds that their presence in the north is needed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The Free Democrats stance on the issue just as the election campaign takes off caught Mrs. Merkels coalition of conservatives and Social Democrats off guard.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 On Thursday, Franz Josef Jung, the conservative defense minister, who has refused to use the word war to describe the operations of the German contingent, told ARD, the public television channel, that it was possible the army could remain in Afghanistan for 10 more years, until that nations security forces have been trained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Social Democrat foreign minister who will run against Mrs. Merkel for the chancellery, echoed that sentiment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He told the Leipziger Volkszeitung that he believed German soldiers could be in Afghanistan for 10 more years or longer. That will not go down well with his party, which has a strong pacifist wing that opposes the Afghan mission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Critics of the governments policy say it has never adequately explained to the public the strategy and goals of the mission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Among those critics is the Federal Armed Forces Association, a politically independent institution that represents more than 210,000 soldiers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 What is needed more than ever is public support for our men and women serving in Afghanistan, said Wilfried Stolze, the associations spokesman. But the politicians, including the chancellor, have shown no courage in explaining to the public why our troops are there in the first place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkel, who has made two visits to Afghanistan since becoming chancellor nearly four years ago  in late 2007 and last April  has never broached the subject during a prime-time television interview, a speech or a public rally, nor has she suggested that the foreign affairs or defense committees of the Bundestag, or Parliament, hold hearings on the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Stolze said that his group had reservations about the Free Democrats call for a withdrawal plan, but that it approved of the question being put forward publicly so that it could be debated.

 The airstrike, which German forces called in before dawn on Friday after the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/taliban/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; taliban.=&quot;Taliban.&quot;&gt;

 &lt;/a&gt;
 hijacked two tanker trucks carrying NATO fuel. Scores of people were killed, including an uncertain number of civilians.

 When Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/stanley_a_mcchrystal/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; stanley=&quot;Stanley&quot; a.=&quot;A.&quot; mcchrystal.=&quot;McChrystal.&quot;&gt;
  Stanley A. McChrystal
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the commander of the American and NATO force, visited the site of the strike on Saturday, he asked Col. Georg Klein, the German commander, why forces from the Regional Command North had not come here quicker, news agencies reported Monday. The general tightened the rules on airstrikes recently, seeking to avert attacks  causing civilian casualties, which have undermined Afghan support for the war. The tightened rules say that if civilians may be in danger, troops should move in on the ground rather than call in an airstrike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Germany has strict limits on the operations of its troops, which, in practice, means they can only move around during certain hours of the day, whether in convoys or on foot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A spokesman for the German Defense Ministry, Thomas Raabe, during an hourlong grilling by reporters that the decision to order the strike was based on intelligence that  armed Taliban were near the tankers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Reuters reported that Mr. Raabe said: You must realize, we are talking about the middle of the night, with special visibility conditions, where we dont know what the enemy is planning. Therefore I think the decision that was made at the time was absolutely correct.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 At NATO headquarters, some of the countries involved in the fighting in southern Afghanistan were expressing concern that Colonel Klein had called in the NATO bombers but delayed in sending troops to the site of the bombing, according to a NATO diplomat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Rear Admiral Gregory J. Smith, a spokesman for the United States and NATO in Afghanistan, said the delay meant that insurgents could come out with their own version of events before all the facts were known, the agencies reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In the immediate wake of the attack, German officials insisted no civilians had been killed, but Defense Minister  Franz Josef Jung told reporters in Hamburg, I can no longer rule out that civilians were killed, according to The Associated Press.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The numbers continue to be disputed on the ground. On Monday, the Afghan Rights Monitor, a national watchdog group,  said that, after interviews with 15 villagers, it appeared that only  a dozen of the dead were gunmen, but that 60 to 70 villagers were killed, The A.P. reported. But it also noted that a spokesman for the provincial government, Ahmad Sami Yawar, said only 5 of the dead  were civilians.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkels decision to address Parliament reflected growing concern by her conservative bloc that the war in Afghanistan, which is highly unpopular among the German public,  could become a major campaign issue in elections  on Sept. 27.  She is seeking reelection,  and her party hopes to  ousting the Social Democrats as coalition partners and replace them with the pro-business Free Democrats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 We do not want Afghanistan to become part of the election campaign, said Erika Hoff, a federal legislator and foreign policy expert for the Free Democrats. It could damage the chances of a new coalition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkel called Sunday for an international conference on Afghanistan,  though a major one was recently held in Paris in June. Speaking in Berlin with
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/gordon_brown/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; gordon=&quot;Gordon&quot; brown.=&quot;Brown.&quot;&gt;
  Gordon Brown
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the British prime minister, Mrs. Merkel said the conference,  involving NATO, the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; united=&quot;United&quot; nations.=&quot;Nations.&quot;&gt;
  United Nations
 &lt;/a&gt;
 and Afghanistan, would concentrate on how and when the Afghan authorities could take over more responsibility for security. Germany has 4,200 troops in the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Along with the United States, Germany  held responsibility until last year for training a new Afghan police force. But the German training  was considered so inadequate by the United States and other NATO countries that it was handed over to the

 Mrs. Merkel addressed Parliament in the face of growing scrutiny of the decision by a German commander to have American aircraft bomb two gas tanker trucks hijacked by the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/taliban/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; taliban.=&quot;Taliban.&quot;&gt;
  Taliban
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , in an apparent contradiction of new rules intended to reduce civilian casualties. While she said that she deeply regrets any innocent victims, Mrs. Merkel also said that she would not accept premature judgments over the airstrikes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 After what I have experienced during the last few days, I say this quite clearly: I refuse to tolerate this, regardless from whom  both at home and abroad, she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 NATO announced Tuesday that Gen.
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/stanley_a_mcchrystal/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; stanley=&quot;Stanley&quot; a.=&quot;A.&quot; mcchrystal.=&quot;McChrystal.&quot;&gt;
  Stanley A. McChrystal
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, had appointed a Canadian, Maj. Gen. C. S. Sullivan, to lead the formal investigation into the airstrike, which took place early Friday. According to a
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nato.int/isaf/docu/pressreleases/2009/09/pr090908-681.html&quot; title=&quot;The&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; release=&quot;release&quot;&gt;

  United States Air Force
 &lt;/a&gt;
 officer and a German legal adviser will be part of the investigating team. NATO officials expect the investigation to take several weeks to complete.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 According to the news release, reviews of the strike indicated that along with insurgents, civilians also were killed and injured in the strike. There have been conflicting reports about the number of victims and whether they were Taliban fighters or civilians. An independent Afghan watchdog group said Monday that between 60 and 70 villagers were killed in the strike. But officials on the ground have said that most of the dead were fighters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The swift burial of victims at the scene of the airstrike, near the city of Kunduz, as well as the fact that German troops did not inspect the location until hours after the bombing, have added to the confusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The deadly bombing took place amid rising fatigue and disenchantment in
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/germany/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; germany.=&quot;Germany.&quot;&gt;
  Germany
 &lt;/a&gt;
 with the mission in Afghanistan, as the number and intensity of Taliban attacks increase and more reports of voter fraud in the recent presidential election have come to light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It remains to be seen whether the attack, and the rift it has caused between German and American military leaders, could prove a turning point in the way the allies cooperate   or whether it could encourage an earlier pullout by Germany, which at times has seemed a reluctant participant. The United States has 68,000 troops in Afghanistan, compared with a combined total of about 40,000 troops  from other countries fighting in the NATO-led mission. Germany has roughly 4,200 troops there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 On Sunday at a news conference in Berlin, Mrs. Merkel and Prime Minister
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/gordon_brown/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; gordon=&quot;Gordon&quot; brown.=&quot;Brown.&quot;&gt;

 of Britain
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/world/europe/07germany.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  called for an international conference
 &lt;/a&gt;
 to work on a plan for shifting responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the Afghan government, a proposal that they said Frances president,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/nicolas_sarkozy/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nicolas=&quot;Nicolas&quot; sarkozy=&quot;Sarkozy&quot;&gt;
  Nicolas Sarkozy
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , also supported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The timing  of the airstrike   just ahead of  parliamentary elections in Germany on Sept. 27   has raised the stakes for politicians like Mrs. Merkel who have backed the unpopular mission. Polls show that roughly two-thirds of Germans oppose the presence of the countrys troops in Afghanistan. But Mrs. Merkels main rivals have been handcuffed by the fact that it was their left-leaning government under the previous chancellor,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/gerhard_schroder/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; gerhard=&quot;Gerhard&quot; schroder.=&quot;Schroder.&quot;&gt;
  Gerhard Schrder
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , that sent troops to Afghanistan in the first place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In the past, NATO allies engaged in the more dangerous south complained that the Germans refused to fight. But in recent months, the relatively peaceful northern part of Afghanistan has been the scene of increased Taliban attacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Speaking in the Reichstag building on Tuesday morning, Mrs. Merkel told Parliament that every innocent person killed in Afghanistan is one too many, calling for a complete review of the  strike. But Mrs. Merkel took issue with the rapid criticism aimed at the German military in Afghanistan and the government in Berlin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The bombing is a particularly delicate issue because it is the deadliest episode involving German troops since World War II. In a news conference on Monday, a Defense Ministry spokesman drew attention to the fact that the German commander on the ground ordered the warplanes to use 500-pound bombs rather than the 2,000-pound bombs suggested by the pilots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Domestically, disapproval over the airstrike has focused on the defense minister, Franz Josef Jung, particularly for his assertions in the days after the strike that only Taliban fighters had been killed. Your policy has been: cover up, deny, and when nothing else works, apologize for that which you previously disputed, Jrgen Trittin, head of the Green Party delegation in Parliament, said during the debate after Mrs. Merkels statement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But despite its extreme unpopularity, the war in Afghanistan has yet to become a major election issue. That stems in no small part from the fact that the mission began during the previous government, a coalition of the left-leaning Social Democrats and the Green Party. The Social Democrats are now the junior party in a coalition with Mrs. Merkels conservative Christian Democrats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germanys foreign minister and Mrs. Merkels Social Democratic challenger in the upcoming election, struck many of the same notes as his political rival on Tuesday.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 There is one thing I do not understand, that before the investigation is complete premature judgments are being made, also abroad, Mr. Steinmeier said in what was the last scheduled session of Parliament before the election. He also spoke out against a quick withdrawal. We cannot rashly depart, Mr. Steinmeier said. That just wont work. It would be irresponsible.

 BERLIN  Germany, the postwar version, has never really sorted out how to engage fully in military risk-taking with its most important Western allies while abandoning its halfway house caveats of limited combat involvement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In the 1990s, at the time of German reunification, Chancellor Helmut Kohl trumpeted how normal and exemplary  Germany had become. Yet he did not find a sufficiently good or comfortable enough cause in Saddam Husseins invasion of Kuwait for German troops to join the West in expelling him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In large part, Germanys allies  the United States, in particular  let this pass. In doing so, they honored the remarkable German determination to confront and exorcise the countrys history of barbaric war-making and militarism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But over the following decades, while mumbling about democratic Germanys seemingly outdated constitutional constraints, the allies also allowed the Germans, as they joined the Wests military engagements in the Balkans and Afghanistan, to hold onto the advantage of a convenient moral obligation: a kind of opt-out from maximal shared risk and, instead, a place on the battlefield at a remove from the worst fighting and dying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Concerning German troops in Afghanistan, this permitted the current Berlin government not just to cast them for German public opinion as community service workers in camouflage uniforms, but to tacitly separate the Grand Coalition from direct responsibility for the wars lack of success and its civilian casualties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 All of a sudden, Afghanistan has burst into the German consciousness two weeks before elections on Sept. 27.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It is an exceptional intrusion into a humdrum process in which the coalition partners, the Christian Democrats of Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Social Democrats, share the same record of caution and limited implication: Until last week, a comfortable joint subtext on the Afghan issue was how soon German forces might leave.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Then this: A German colonel in the northern province of Kunduz, describing his troops as in danger after two oil tanker trucks were abandoned near them, called for an airstrike by U.S. fighter jets that resulted in the deaths of scores of Afghans. The strike was made without proper authorization, even though, according to German news reports, German troops could have been dispatched to the area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Certainly,  there was no suggestion that the German soldiers were cowardly. Rather, it seemed, their officer was following political instructions to minimize combat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 This would contradict newly laid-out tactics for fighting the Taliban from Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. and NATO commander in the region: more engagement on the ground by Germans and other units in the north against the insurgents, and avoiding air action that could affect civilians. These circumstances reflect a Taliban thrust into the perceived softness of the north following U.S. reinforcements in the southern region where the Canadians, British, Dutch and Danes have been present  but not the Germans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 An Associated Press account from Kabul of a confrontation between General McChrystal and the Bundeswehr colonel referred to a context of concern about restrictions on use of German troops and included the views of an American military analyst, Anthony Cordesman. He described German troops in Afghanistan as being as oriented toward staying in their armored vehicles as any group Ive met. Theyre not active enough to present much of a threat to the Taliban most of the time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A follow-up German editorial or two  one branding General McChrystal as discredited  argued that splits among allies created by the American commanders singling out of the German officer outdid the Talibans own successes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But further reaction
 &lt;span class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;
  inside
 &lt;/span&gt;
 Germany, and among other German allies, suggested that General McChrystal had touched a raw, normally avoided nerve. While increased American casualties have raised political opposition within the United States against a conflict President Barack Obama has described as the right war, the fabric of Germanys arms-length policy came under another kind of questioning and criticism:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Gen. Klaus Naumann, a former Bundeswehr inspector general and chairman of NATOs Military Committee, said the German politicians and military men who had gone over the top in the past in their criticism of American tactics were not exactly examples of readiness for risk or shared responsibility
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In an editorial commentary, The Financial Times Deutschland called into doubt the success of the training for the Afghan police that Germany has always held up as its major contribution to combating the Taliban. It wrote, no area over the past eight years has been so criminally neglected by the Germans as this one
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 And Sueddeutsche Zeitung, reporting on the attitudes of German soldiers in Afghanistan, described them as highly emotional in accusing German politicians of failing to explain the real situation on the ground, which the troops said requires fighting the Taliban massively and accepting the possibility of both civilian and German casualties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I talked to Theo  Farrell of the department of war studies at Kings College, London, about the situation. He found the cat pretty much out of the bag on what he called a particular culture of risk and said that as the Taliban push the war in on the Bundeswehr, it must take a more robust approach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Heres Mrs. Merkel on this: With public opinion strongly against the war and her chances of re-election good, shes taking a full-circle approach to cover every potential voter. Germany, she says, claims no special status in Afghanistan (while making no mention of its list of caveats), but wont be pushed around by complaining allies, and would like the Afghans to be ready to defend themselves within five years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 All clear now?

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The fiscal crisis, shaking the Greek government while driving down the value of
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/currency/euro/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; euro.=&quot;Euro.&quot;&gt;
  the euro
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , is forcing taxpayers and voters across Europe to confront the fact that their fortunes are tied together more closely than their politicians confessed in the late 1990s, in the rush to create the common currency over public objections.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In the process it has revealed how deeply national identity, rather than a common European identity, remains the reality on the Continent. Solidarity, at least in the eyes of most voters, still stops at the border.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Despite popular opposition to helping Greece, analysts expect big countries like France and
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/info/germany?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; germany.=&quot;Germany.&quot;&gt;
  Germany
 &lt;/a&gt;
 to reach some kind of deal, since the prospect of economic chaos without an agreement is more frightening than even the wrath of voters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Just like Obama is not going to let a systemic bank fail, Europe is not going to kick the wayward out of the system, said
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hoover.org/bios/joffe.html&quot; title=&quot;Bio&quot; of=&quot;of&quot; joffe=&quot;Joffe&quot;&gt;
  Josef Joffe
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , the publisher of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit. But he added that the reason for that could not be kept from the voters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Europe has become a huge welfare state for everybody, for states as well as individuals, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Greeces finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, told his counterparts on Monday that a firmer commitment to helping his country was needed to fend off speculators. Other ministers in the euro zone lectured Greece about using complex financial instruments prepared by Wall Street to hide debt and called for a tighter clampdown on spending, rather than outlining the specifics of an aid package that would calm markets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 European leaders want to extract guarantees from the Greeks to put their finances in order before offering any kind of rescue, but their reticence also stems from the fact that any price tag will have to be defended at home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Here in Germany, opinion surveys show that two-thirds of the people oppose financial assistance for Greece. More ominously, a survey released Sunday by the newspaper Bild showed that a slight majority of Germans, 53 percent, said they favored expelling Greece from the euro group entirely if its mountain of debt threatened the stability of the currency union.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Every country has its own debts, said Kristin Lautenschlger, 70, a retiree in Berlin who said she opposed spending German money to save Greece. Germany is no longer such a rich country anymore, and has its own problems to deal with before it can take care of Greeces.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Germans spent the past decade cutting unemployment benefits and freezing pensions, while grudgingly accepting stagnant wages in order to make their economy more competitive. After those years of sacrifice, it is more than just a matter of money that is driving opposition to the bailout, but also a matter of principle, after politicians promised they would never have to prop up their neighbors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The crisis could not have come at a worse moment for Chancellor
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/angela_merkel/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; angela=&quot;Angela&quot; merkel.=&quot;Merkel.&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Now with the American economy in the midst of a more robust, if still fragile, recovery, the Germany economy has stalled, with no growth in the fourth quarter, according to an announcement Friday by the government statistics office.

 There was a belief in the beginning that this was an American problem. I dont think the dots were connected across Europe, that you have the unpredictability within the zone itself, said

 Now they have to pay for Greece and everybodys trying to figure out how you can do that while staying politically viable at home, Mr. Janes said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In Germany, the debate over aid to the Greeks intensified last week when the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,676839,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Spiegel&quot; online=&quot;Online&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
  ruled
 &lt;/a&gt;
 that unpopular labor-market reforms, known as Hartz IV, may have gone too far in cutting benefits for the countrys unemployed. That set off a political fight within the German government over jobless assistance, one that was inevitably framed as helping Germans or saving Greeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I cant explain to a Hartz IV recipient that he wont get another cent but some Greek gets to retire at 63, said Michael Fuchs, a deputy leader in Parliament of Mrs. Merkels Christian Democrats, in Sundays issue of the newspaper Die Welt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The lack of common fiscal policies for the bloc meant built-in instability for the euro, but years without a major

 covered it up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Now it is clear that unlike the United States, where the federal government has the power to help individual states, Europe lacks the mechanisms to steady its struggling nations, and the uncertainty is causing some critics to call the very future of the currency union into question.

 in Washington.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A bailout for Greece would not be as expensive as the fraught public debate might suggest, Mr. Posen said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The amount of additional fiscal aid needed for Greece is not that great, he said. Politically its sensitive, but economically the costs are vastly overrated versus the benefits accrued to date and to come.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But voters in Germany see the decision to bail out Greece as just the first step in what will be a long line of countries seeking handouts. After Greece it will just be other countries like Portugal, said Patrick Klomfas, 28, an unemployed automotive engineer, who on Monday was visiting the employment office in the Berlin neighborhood of Lichtenberg.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But you know, the politicians are just going to do what they want to do anyway, said Mr. Klomfas, who has been out of work since October, but expects to start a new job next month. No one wanted the euro, but the euro came anyway.

 BERLIN  The Greek financial crisis has given German bloggers a great opportunity to say what they really think about the European Union and especially the euro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Give us back our Deutsche mark, wrote one blogger. Another told Britain, which is not a member of the euro zone, to stay away. Its not worth it. Keep your pound. We should have kept our D-Mark.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It is hard to gauge just how deep such nostalgia for the German mark runs. But one thing is certain. For Germans, the mark was more than just currency. It symbolized the spectacular economic recovery of West Germany from the ruins of World War II. The worldwide respect it commanded became an immense source of pride for Germans. No wonder that when Germans exchanged their marks for euro coins in 2002, there was seething resentment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 So if Germany now is forced to bail out Greece and later protect Spain and Portugal against speculators, it could easily revive that resentment against Europe and the common currency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The Germans are angry, said Elmar Brok, a leading member of Chancellor Angela Merkels Christian Democratic Union party and European Parliament legislator. We have had to bail out our own banks, and now we have to help Greece. But what can we do? We have no choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 If the speculators are successful in Greece, Mr. Brok said, it is only a matter of time before they make an attempt against another country. It will be an attack on all of us, on Europe. That is why we have to find new ways to defend the euro, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkel now finds herself in an extremely difficult position.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 She knows that the euro has been good for Germany, despite the resentment. Exchange-rate stability in their most important markets has proved a big plus for German companies. Since the launch of the euro, Germany has constantly gained competitiveness against its euro-peers, said Nicolaus Heinen, expert on economic and European policy issues at Deutsche Bank.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But bailing out Greece would be terribly unpopular, German officials say. Mrs. Merkel would send a signal to other profligate E.U. spenders that Berlin would always rescue them. And at home, where the news media have carried scathing reports on the lack of fiscal discipline, the doctoring of official statistics and lavish spending of E.U. funds in parts of Southern Europe, it could turn into a political nightmare.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 So at the E.U. summit meeting last week, Mrs. Merkel played for time. She agreed to give Greece four weeks to institute radical spending cuts even though many analysts are doubtful the Greek government will be able to bring down its deficit sufficiently.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkel is using this time to explore new possibilities of introducing fiscal discipline in the euro zone. For the first time earlier this month she spoke about the need for a European economic government. Merkel has come round to the idea that if you have a monetary union, then you need economic governance, Mr. Brok said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 For years, that idea was taboo in Germany. Since the 1990s, when the European Union was preparing to introduce the euro, France has regularly called for the introduction of an economic government in Europe, partly to coordinate fiscal policies and spending programs and partly to check the power of the European Central Bank.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Helmut Kohl, the conservative former chancellor, was a passionate believer in an ever-closer political and economic union for Europe and gave up the cherished German mark for the euro. But he was never going to compromise the independence of the European Central Bank. Neither Mr. Kohl nor his successors trusted Frances motives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 German leaders feared, and rightly so, that France would undermine the independence of the European Central Bank by launching grandiose projects and social spending plans that would cost Germany dearly, said Franois Heisbourg, council chairman of the Institute for Strategic Studies in London.

&lt;p&gt;
 BERLIN  When Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany meets Prime Minister George A. Papandreou of Greece on Friday, she will be playing to several different audiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 As the leader of the country with Europes largest economy and as the stout defender of fiscal rectitude within the euro zone, Mrs. Merkel is under pressure from her European partners to go along with some sort of financial rescue plan that would protect the common currency, which is the foundation of political and economic unity across the Continent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But she is also a national politician, and if the popular German press is anything to go by, Germans are in no mood to throw a lifeline to Greece, one of the 16 nations of the euro zone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Bild Zeitung, a mass circulation daily, has published lurid articles about how the Greeks, apart from being lazy and able to retire in their early 50s, have wasted billions of euros showered on them by the European Union.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Adding fuel to the fire, Greek newspapers have sought their revenge for what they see as Germanys selfishness and arrogance. They have reopened the wounds of World War II, accusing Germany of refusing to pay reparations during the time it occupied Greece.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 And that is only the newspapers. The blogs from both poles of Europe are much more extreme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 For Mrs. Merkel, it may be impossible to satisfy everybody. But her biggest challenge is hanging on to the core group of voters who returned her to office for a second term at the head of a coalition that includes her preferred partner, the market-oriented Free Democrats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 That group is centered in places like Zehlendorf, an affluent southwestern district of Berlin where Mrs. Merkels conservative Christian Democratic Union has enjoyed wide support for years. And they seem to be hoping that Mrs. Merkel can find some sort of compromise between the extremes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I cant stand this populist stuff, said Uli Becker, a 41-year-old physician. We know that Greece was not ready to join the euro and we know how they wasted the money. But it would be a catastrophe for Germany and to the euro if we allowed Greece to collapse. We have to help, provided Greece starts changing its ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Help, perhaps, but not with Germany shouldering the burden alone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 All E.U countries have to help, said Ushi Kunz, a 65-year-old pensioner. We have to save the euro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 To be sure, Mrs. Kunz never wanted to give up the German mark in the first place. I was really against it, she recalled. The Deutsche mark was ours. Then it was gone. Prices jumped.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But she added: You cant go back. What we have, we have to protect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 For many Germans, it is up to the Greeks to deal with their own mistakes first before receiving a bailout. Whether the additional austerity measures that the Greek government announced Wednesday go far enough remains to be seen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I know its all about the future of the euro, said Maria Bhme, who was with her 4-year-old granddaughter and was interviewed while seeking shelter from a sudden snow shower. I know we cannot reverse history. But still.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 That ambivalence means that Mrs. Merkel has to tread carefully during her meeting with Mr. Papandreou. So whatever deal, if any, is struck on Friday, Mrs. Merkel can ill afford any sniping afterwards, either from the populist press or from her own coalition partners. The main reason is that Mrs. Merkels dream coalition of conservatives and pro-business Free Democrats has lost its shine since taking office in November.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The coalition has spent most of that time bickering over health reform, the social welfare system and the future of the countrys nuclear power stations. It has left the public disappointed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The coalition argues all the time, said Mr. Becker, the doctor. So little has been achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkel admitted as much in a television interview Sunday night. There was more public sparring than solutions, she said.

   Angela Merkel
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , praised Greeces latest austerity measures as an inordinately important step, and the Greek prime minister, George A. Papandreou, defended the package   which has provoked outrage at home   as critical to stabilizing his countrys finances.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We had to take difficult decisions, but these decisions were necessary if we are to lead our country out of the crisis, he said. He added that he had not asked Germany for financial support.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the Greek capital, meanwhile, strikes hit schools, hospitals and public transportation and police used tear gas on the rioters in Athens as Parliament adopted its latest austerity package. Seven police officers were injured in the protests, among the most violent since  Greeces
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/credit_crisis/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; credit=&quot;credit&quot; crisis.=&quot;crisis.&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  hit, and  at least five demonstrators were arrested.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The oversubscribed sale of nearly $7 billion in bonds on Thursday gave the Greek government much-needed breathing room in its scramble for new loans, and  also took pressure off Mrs. Merkel to make a firm commitment to help Greece out of its fiscal  predicament.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The two countries have been locked in an increasingly bitter war of words fought through the news media and lower-ranking politicians over Greeces debt problems and the expectation that taxpayers from Germany, Europes largest economy, would bail them out. The dispute has exposed a gap between the declarations  of solidarity in Europe and the nationalist sentiments that still rule public opinion.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While the Greek government is struggling to convince markets to help it bridge its financing gap, there is plenty at stake for Germany as well. With $43.6 billion in loans, German banks have the third-highest exposure to Greece.
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/deutsche_bank_ag/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; deutsche=&quot;Deutsche&quot; bank=&quot;Bank&quot; ag=&quot;AG&quot;&gt;

   Josef Ackermann
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , even flew to Athens last week to meet with Mr. Papandreou and other senior officials, sparking rumors a deal with the Germans was imminent.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  A bailout of Greece would be far less expensive than the potential fallout from a chain reaction a debt crises leading to larger  countries with budget woes, like Spain and Italy. But Mrs. Merkel, known at home for her patience and often described by friends and foes alike as a consummate political poker player, has stuck to platitudes, generalities and lectures that the Greeks must do their own homework.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  So far shes kept her cards hidden, which I think is smart, said Michael Strmer, the chief correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt. In principle, her tactic is to hold herself in reserve, hold Germany in reserve.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Even before Mr. Papandreou arrived in Berlin Friday, the German economy minister, Rainer Brderle, had a stark message for him.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The German government does not intend to give one cent, Mr. Brderle told reporters here in the capital.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  An interview with Mr. Papandreou published Friday in the German daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ahead of his visit, aimed to calm public sentiment in Germany.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We have not asked the German taxpayers to rescue us, to pay for our retirements and vacations, Mr. Papandreou said. We are not asking for money. What we need is the support of the E.U. and our European partners so that we can receive credit from the market at better terms. Relations between the two countries have taken a sour turn in recent weeks as German news media outlets accused the Greeks of corruption, tax evasion and falsifying their budget numbers to join the euro zone. Greek politicians in turn have asked for reparations for damage inflicted by Nazi occupiers during World War II.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germany has the most fiscal flexibility among
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; european=&quot;European&quot; union.=&quot;Union.&quot;&gt;
   European Union
  &lt;/a&gt;
  members to help Greece, but public opposition to any assistance has been vehement. The debate has crystallized broader German misgivings about the European project into a public outcry.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Its like a mosaic and the Greece crisis is the last stone, said Wolfgang Nowak, a former senior adviser to Mrs. Merkels predecessor,
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/gerhard_schroder/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; gerhard=&quot;Gerhard&quot; schroder.=&quot;Schroder.&quot;&gt;
   Gerhard Schrder
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , and head of Deutsche Banks International Forum. More and more there is the feeling that French farmers, Polish farmers, Spanish infrastructure, that Europe is not a community but something held together by a German pay check.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While protesters have not taken to the streets of Berlin in large numbers the way they have in Athens, Mrs. Merkel faces rising dissatisfaction at home. A new poll Friday found nearly three-quarters of Germans critical of her governments performance since she  was reelected last September.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  With a crucial election in Germanys largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, barely two months away, Mrs. Merkel would be taking an enormous political risk by pledging support to Greece, which is seen as having a bloated public sector and excessively generous benefits, even by European standards.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  There would be no understanding in the population or in her own party if Germany would go it alone with help for Greece, said Jrgen Falter, a political science professor at the University of Mainz.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The German press has been filled with stories detailing the tens of billions of dollars worth of European Union funds Greece has received in recent years. At the same time, stories of tax-dodging doctors and marinas filled with yachts have become staples of news reports here.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  One of the most-cited statistics, and for Germans most infuriating, comes from the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/o/organization_for_economic_cooperation_and_development/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; organization=&quot;Organization&quot; for=&quot;for&quot; economic=&quot;Economic&quot; cooperation=&quot;Cooperation&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; development=&quot;Development&quot;&gt;
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , showing that the median Greek retiree takes home 95.7 of his or her last salary, while the German pensioner gets only 43 percent. That is viewed as evidence that the Germans have taken painful cuts in their benefits to keep industry competitive and budget deficits under control, while the Greeks have not.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We Europeans, despite our long history of cooperation, often indulge in the habit of throwing stones at each other, forgetting that we live in a glass house, said Loukas Tsoukalis, president of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, an Athens research group. The good news, according to Mr. Tsoukalis, was that a large majority of Greeks recognized that the problem was theirs to solve.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Its really something new that you have a government that announces pretty unpleasant measures that will have a real effect on peoples standard of living, and you have 75 percent of Greeks, depending on the opinion poll, who say they agree with the measures, said Mr. Tsoukalis.

 KABUL (AP) -- The man chosen to be the fresh face of good Afghan governance in a town just seized from the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/taliban/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; taliban.=&quot;Taliban.&quot;&gt;
  Taliban
 &lt;/a&gt;
 has a violent criminal record in Germany, but Western officials said Saturday they are not pushing to oust him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Court records and news reports in Germany show that Abdul Zahir, the man appointed as the new civilian chief in Marjah, served part of a more than four-year prison sentence for stabbing his son in 1998. A U.S. official confirmed that he did serve time in Germany, though Zahir denies he committed any crime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 ``I was not a killer. I was not a smuggler. ... I didn`t commit any crime,`` Zahir told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Friday evening. He said allegations of a criminal record were ``all a lie.``
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Zahir`s integrity is an issue because his job is to convince residents of the town in Helmand province that the Afghan government can provide them with a better life than the Taliban, which were routed during a three-week offensive by thousands of U.S.,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/north_atlantic_treaty_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; north=&quot;North&quot; atlantic=&quot;Atlantic&quot; treaty=&quot;Treaty&quot; organization.=&quot;Organization.&quot;&gt;
  NATO
 &lt;/a&gt;
 and Afghan troops. Marjah is the first major test of NATO`s counterinsurgency strategy since President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; barack=&quot;Barack&quot; obama=&quot;Obama&quot;&gt;
  Barack Obama
 &lt;/a&gt;
 ordered 30,000 new American troops to try to reverse the Taliban`s momentum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Adm. Gregory Smith, director of communications for NATO, said the international alliance strongly supports Helmand Gov. Gulab Mangal, who picked Zahir for the job. ``Zahir, from our reporting, is doing good work down there,`` Smith said Saturday, adding that NATO is not pushing Afghan officials to oust him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Zahir said he lived in Germany for 15 years before returning to Afghanistan in 2000. During his time in Germany, he said he worked in a hotel and at a laundry service.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Zahir, a leading member of the Alizai tribe, has lived with his family for the past four years in Helmand`s capital, Lashkar Gah, residents of the city said. He worked there with Jilani Popal, head of the Afghan Independent Directorate of Local Government, an agency seeking to boost the effectiveness and capacity of local governments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He said he took the job as civilian chief in Marjah because ``I love my country and my country needed me. My relatives, my tribe were here.``
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Zahir said his adversaries in Afghanistan were trying to tarnish his reputation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 ``This news is coming from those people who are against me,`` he said. ``They are against my relations with the foreigners. They want to sabotage me. They don`t want such a person to serve the people, who has good relations with Americans, British, and foreigners.``
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In an interview last week, Mangal, the governor of Helmand, said he wasn`t aware of anything illegal in Zahir`s background.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 ``He is not being appointed forever, but he will be here for some time,`` he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mangal said that a request was made of Interpol to check whether the new Marjah district governor had any outstanding warrants or was being sought. He said Interpol said he was not on any watch list or wanted for any crime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Zahir has been tasked with bringing good governance to Marjah and ensuring that the new police in the area are symbolic of a new breed of Afghan policeman that is honest and committed to bringing security to the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 ``In Marjah we have a new strategy,`` Mangal said. ``If we don`t bring security and development and if we don`t solve their problems, then they will think the Taliban is better than us.``
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 If Zahir isn`t up to the task, Mangal said, ``We will dismiss him. If he doesn`t have the ability, if he doesn`t bring law and order and security, then we will dismiss him.``
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In Kabul, President
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/hamid_karzai/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; hamid=&quot;Hamid&quot; karzai.=&quot;Karzai.&quot;&gt;
  Hamid Karzai`s
 &lt;/a&gt;
 spokesman Waheed Omar said he wasn`t familiar with Zahir but that Marjah`s residents will support the government if it brings security and an administration free of corruption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Omar warned that poor governance could drive residents back to the Taliban.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Court and news accounts from the late 1990s provide details of Zahir`s past.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Annette von Schmiedeberg, a spokeswoman for the Offenbach branch of the prosecutor`s office in Darmstadt in central Germany, said Friday that an Afghan citizen with the name Abdul Z. was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison for attempted manslaughter by the county court in Darmstadt on Nov. 2, 1998. Von Schmiedeberg said that in accordance with German privacy laws she could not give the full name or details about the crime.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 A person familiar with Zahir and the 1998 court sentencing in Germany identified him Friday for the AP after viewing a pair of photographs of him taken last month. He asked that his name not be published because he feared for his life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 An American official in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, also confirmed that Zahir has a criminal record in Germany.

 In recent days, novel solutions to the Greek debt crisis have surfaced, though perhaps not the constructive ones European leaders desperate to hold their struggling union together were hoping to hear.

  A pair of German politicians, incensed at the thought of paying for a bailout of the profligates to the south, suggested Thursday that the Greeks consider plugging the large hole in their budget by selling off some of their lovely islands. Several Greek politicians and commentators have argued that the Germans should pony up reparations for the death and destruction wrought by the Nazis during World War II.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  These would not be the coolest heads prevailing.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In times of economic growth and rising prosperity, the continents shared and all-too-often unhappy history was a lot easier to paper over. Now that theres room for blame and recrimination, the history suddenly matters.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germans, still smarting from the replacement of their beloved Deutsche mark with the euro, harbor deep suspicions that European unity boils down to them perpetually handing out their hard-earned money, an inerasable debt for the horrors of Nazism.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The German news magazine Focus recently summed up the feeling with a cover featuring the Venus de Milo statue, one arm restored to hold up a middle finger at the reader, with the headline Swindlers in the Euro Family. Greeks were less than pleased to see an image of the ancient goddess Aphrodite profaned, and the Nazi slurs began in earnest.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Old stereotypes have come to the fore  the crooked Greeks and the stingy Germans  with the addition of the sweeping acronym P.I.I.G.S. forcing together Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain. The tension marks a crisis for the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; european=&quot;European&quot; union.=&quot;Union.&quot;&gt;
   European Union
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and not just the euro, because it has exposed how deep the fault lines between nations still run, despite decades of integration.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Sometimes you rub your eyes in disbelief at whats happening between the two countries, but particularly from Germany toward Greece, said Jens Bastian, a German economist who has lived in Greece for 13 years, and whose wife is Greek. I have some explaining to do at home about this. He said he doubted his countrymen understood how all the lecturing and bullying about reining in spending and raising taxes, though admittedly a fiscal necessity, came across in Greece.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Whether under Nazi rule during the war, or the more than 300 years as part of the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/ottoman_empire/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; ottoman=&quot;Ottoman&quot; empire.=&quot;Empire.&quot;&gt;
   Ottoman Empire
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Greece is a country that viscerally understands foreign dominance.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Few recall today, but the Greek War of Independence (from the Ottomans) was followed by 30 years under the rule of a king from what today is Germany. In 1832, a 17-year-old Bavarian prince became King Otto I of Greece, chosen by Britain, France and Russia, ushering in an era of unpopular foreign rule labeled Bavarokratia.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Foreign interference goes right back to the beginning of the Greek state and its something that Greeks are very much aware of, said Mark Mazower, a professor specializing in Greek history at
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/columbia_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; columbia=&quot;Columbia&quot; university.=&quot;University.&quot;&gt;
   Columbia University
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . A coup sent Otto into exile in Bavaria in 1862, but that was hardly the end of German influence in Greece.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The year after Greece lost another war against the Ottomans, Germany joined five other European powers in imposing the International Financial Commission on Greece in 1898. The commission controlled customs duties at ports including Piraeus and Corfu; state monopolies for products such as kerosene, matches and playing cards; and duties on stamps and tobacco consumption, all to ensure that Greece continued repaying its loans.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Its somewhat understandable that the Greeks today would bristle at the proposition that to service their debt they auction off the Aegean islands, as suggested by Josef Schlarmann, a senior member of Chancellor
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/angela_merkel/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; angela=&quot;Angela&quot; merkel.=&quot;Merkel.&quot;&gt;
   Angela Merkel
  &lt;/a&gt;
  s Christian Democrats, and Frank Schffler of their coalition partners, the Free Democrats.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  When youre bankrupt you have to sell everything to pay off your creditors, Mr. Schffler told the populist German newspaper Bild on Thursday. Greece owns buildings, companies and uninhabited islands, which could all be used for discharging debt. Bild also published a headline last week that read Can we take the euro from Greece? and it suggested the Greeks could get about $140 billion for the Acropolis.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The euro was devised not only to lower transaction costs and reap the benefits of a major reserve currency. It was also meant to serve as a symbol of a European identity, an identity intended to move the continent beyond centuries of warfare and toward unprecedented harmony.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The crisis over the euro could be its undoing, as the most pessimistic observers say, or it could be a necessary setback, one that forces Europeans to rededicate themselves to their ideals and put together better fiscal mechanisms for managing their common currency.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While the war of clichs hurts, polls showed that a majority of Greeks understood that their government had gotten them into the current fiscal bind, and it was their job to get out, said Kostas Kalfopoulos, who writes about cultural issues for the Greek daily Kathimerini. If you are in the European family you have to accept the rules of this family.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  And after enacting a series of tough measures to raise revenues and cut spending, the Greek government found unexpected success in selling nearly $7 billion worth of bonds late in the week, a hopeful sign that they might find a way to dig themselves out after all. It remains to be seen how quickly good will can be restored after so much nastiness.

&lt;p&gt;
 PARIS  Ten years after the euro, its still all about Germany, which isnt the way it was supposed to be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In the run-up to the common currencys debut in 1999, the air was thick with talk about harnessing Germanys economic power, then enshrined in the mark. A failure to move toward monetary union would lead only to a preponderant influence of Germany, Valry Giscard dEstaing, the former president of France, said in a 1997 interview in the French daily Le Monde.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Now, as the European Union thrashes out a possible rescue plan for debt-stricken Greece, the importance of Germany has been thrown back into relief. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France can come out and pledge all the support to Greece he wants, but in the end, its Germany that matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 This isnt just because it has Europes most powerful economy and its largest population. It is because Germany has proved to be a paragon of its own virtues: thrift and hard work. That cant help but annoy its more profligate neighbors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It has been clear for weeks that if Greece is to get any help from Europe, it must persuade Germany first, which is why everyone keeps taking the German populations temperature on the idea of a bailout. The response is overwhelmingly negative. One German magazine put the Greek statue Venus de Milo on its cover, with its middle finger up in the air, under a headline that said Swindlers in the Euro Family.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 This kind of hostile reaction has only convinced the Greeks that this crisis is a two-way tug-of-war. Greek politicians have called on Germany to pay compensation for its occupation during World War II. The Venus insult was matched in Athens by a mock-up of the charioteer on top of Berlins Brandenburg Gate, this one waving a swastika.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The Dutch, French, Italians and other Europeans dont even get an effigy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Average Germans, who were the euros most reluctant converts, always had doubts about southern Europes big spenders. That has added a petulant I-told-you-so element to the political dilemma faced by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Germanys fiscal situation suffered in the last year, just like everyone elses. However, its deficit  now 3.3 percent of gross domestic product  is well below the deficits of Europes other large economies. With its visceral fear of debt, born during the inflation of the Weimar Republic, Germany took steps to reduce labor costs even before the fiscal crisis, at a time when wages in nearby countries were kept afloat by a debt-fueled boom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The German approach, helped by continuing demand for high-quality German industrial goods, has helped the country export more than it imports. According to Eurostat, the Luxembourg-based statistics agency, Germanys trade surplus in the first 11 months of 2009 was 122.4 billion, or $166.6 billion, followed by the Netherlands in a distant second place, with 35.4 billion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Thats good news for Germany, less so for many of its E.U. neighbors, where almost two-thirds of Germanys customers live. The tension of these relationships is what is making it so hard for the 16 members of the euro zone to come up with a system of joint economic governance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The danger is that the Greek crisis could stoke German disenchantment with any plan to more closely bind the European Union or the euro area. In his February outlook, Willem Buiter, chief economist at Citigroup, said this crisis could make the umbilical attachment of Germanys political elite to the European Union a thing of the past.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Yet unraveling existing links and institutions is virtually impossible, according to Jean-Dominique Giuliani, president of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a research center in Paris.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The interests of all the countries are too intertwined, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 So that leaves Germany to set the example. There is really no alternative to the path Germany has taken, Axel Weber, president of the Bundesbank  whom some see succeeding Jean-Claude Trichet as the president of the European Central Bank  is quoted as saying in The Euro: The Politics of the New Global Currency, by David Marsh.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In other words, the Germans will be vindicated in their long-held view that for the euro to survive, other countries will have to be, well, more German.

   the euro
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , satisfy investors and appease Europes economic taskmaster, Germany, the regions most heavily indebted nations consider that they have no choice but to slim down. Reviving economic growth and reducing unemployment must wait until countries put their fiscal houses in better order, the thinking goes.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But some argue that Berlin is pressing too hard, and that the regions new fixation on debt has created a cult of austerity that could make it harder to recover from the slump. Drastic budget cuts, if carried out as promised, could set off
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/deflation_economics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; deflation.=&quot;deflation.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   deflation
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , send already high unemployment rates surging, bring governments down and even create popular opposition to the euro, critics say.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The pressure will impose terrible strains on the government and society for years to come, said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, professor of economics at the Institut dtudes Politiques in Paris. Its self-defeating, because if you have austerity and deflation in Greece, Portugal and Spain, then the European economy will not recover; firms will fail and jeopardize the banks.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Opposition to austerity is spoken softly in official circles, as political leaders fret that markets will punish countries that show weak resolve to reduce debt. But Germany, which has insisted on steep cuts in public spending in the most indebted nations, is facing criticism for harping about the dangers of debt without doing more to support growth, mainly by buying more from its neighbors.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, warned Berlin that it must raise its domestic demand to help partners in trouble. Could Germany, with its high savings and big trade surplus, do a little something? she asked in an interview with The Financial Times.  It takes two to tango. It cant just be about enforcing deficit principles.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The debate is partly about economics  what steps European countries need to take to tackle their demons of high debt and slow growth. But it is also about leadership, as the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; european=&quot;European&quot; union.=&quot;Union.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   European Union
  &lt;/a&gt;
  struggles to define its mission during the deepest economic crisis in its history.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Germans insist that the problem is debt. Addressing it means radical cuts in public spending immediately, using the pressure from markets to impose changes that are politically difficult but crucial to long-term health.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The euro is facing the strongest challenge it has ever had to cope with, Chancellor
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/angela_merkel/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; angela=&quot;Angela&quot; merkel.=&quot;Merkel.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Angela Merkel
  &lt;/a&gt;
  told the lower house of the German Parliament on Wednesday. A quick act of solidarity is definitely not the right answer. Rather, the right answer is to seize the problem at the roots; therefore there is no alternative to the Greek savings program.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  France has a different, softer approach, akin to the American perspective: public spending must expand in times of economic crisis to increase employment and growth, which will gradually cut the deficit through increased tax receipts. Many European countries need to streamline their public sectors, France argues, but not as shock therapy.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  German rigor has worked well for Germany, which has kept wages down, reformed its social-welfare system and remained one of the worlds top exporting countries. Psychologically, Germans remain obsessed with inflation and saving. But Germany consequently has a big balance-of-trade surplus with its euro-zone partners. And that imbalance makes it harder for less competitive countries to grow their way out of their problems.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Germans note that Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy did not play by the rules of monetary union, drafted largely by Germany. Wages rose very fast, productivity stayed low and governments went on a spending spree, and that makes Germans angry, because they did the opposite, said Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Germans are preaching harsh budget cuts, tax increases, pension reforms, a later retirement age and a quick return to government deficits closer to the European requirement of 3 percent of
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/u/united_states_economy/gross_domestic_product/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; u.s.=&quot;U.S.&quot; gross=&quot;gross&quot; domestic=&quot;domestic&quot; product.=&quot;product.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;

   warns of deficit fetishism,
  &lt;/a&gt;
  arguing that further recession could increase the deficit beyond the governments ability to cut spending.

  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Mr. Fitoussi said, having learned lessons from the Asian crisis of the 1990s, would not try to impose as much austerity all at once, but would rather try to alleviate the immediate debt squeeze and help revive growth before insisting on the biggest cuts.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The United States, too, has taken a different tack, accumulating new debt to stimulate growth and worrying later about reducing deficits. The

   United States budget deficit
  &lt;/a&gt;
  this year will be 11.2 percent of G.D.P. But Washington can better afford it. Not only does it control
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/currency/dollar/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; american=&quot;American&quot; dollar.=&quot;dollar.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   the dollar
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , which remains the worlds reserve currency, but also gross American debt is only half that of Greece when measured against G.D.P.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  France, hit less hard by the crisis, is trying to find a happy medium  with moderate stimulus, no tax increases, support for small and medium enterprises and a deficit growing to 8.2 percent, even as unemployment climbs back over 10 percent.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  To an extent, smaller economies like that of Greece have to bow to the demands of the market. Iceland with its bank disasters and  Ireland with its property and bank bubbles have also buckled down to cut budgets considerably in the face of plunging tax receipts, but their politicians are expected to suffer.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Moreover, accumulated debt in southern Europe has become an urgent issue, with Greece only the most egregious example. The Greek ratio is forecast for 125 percent of G.D.P. and climbing; Italys is nearly 118 percent and the euro zones is 84 percent.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But inevitably the policies to deal with the debt have to balance political and economic realities. Elected governments may promise drastic cuts, but it is not clear that they can stay in office to carry them out.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Greek unions are striking regularly, determined to keep their benefits, and consumer organizations are denouncing a new poverty. Babis Delidaskakis, an economist with INKA, the Greek consumers federation, called the sudden cuts a nefarious dead end for the economy.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Can the Greek government survive this? asked Julian Callow of
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/barclays_plc/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; barclays=&quot;Barclays&quot; plc=&quot;PLC&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;

  Capital. Spain looks better, but the government hasnt even begun to get tough on the fiscal side. This is going to have to be a six-  to eight-year project to stabilize these debt-to-G.D.P. ratios  and it gets progressively harder to keep at it.

   Prime Minister George Papandreou of Greece on Thursday in Brussels. He said he wanted to borrow on reasonable terms.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Turning to the I.M.F. would represent a new and potentially humiliating twist in Greeces financial drama, which was set off by doubts about Athenss ability to borrow 53 billion euros this year to finance a yawning budget deficit and refinance waves of debt coming due.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Worries that investors would shun Greek bonds and force a default shook markets worldwide last month but eased recently after Germany and other members of the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; european=&quot;European&quot; union.=&quot;Union.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   European Union
  &lt;/a&gt;
  signaled they would come to Greeces aid if necessary. The Greek government, in turn, unveiled a long-awaited package of budget cuts.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But prospects for both European aid and domestic spending cuts seemed to fade Thursday with Berlins about-face, as well as a warning from Greeces prime minister that the promised budget cuts might not be enacted unless the country could borrow at lower interest rates.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We will make it, provided that our country can borrow on reasonable terms, Prime Minister
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/george_a_papandreou/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; george=&quot;George&quot; a.=&quot;A.&quot; papandreou.=&quot;Papandreou.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   George A. Papandreou
  &lt;/a&gt;
  said in a cabinet meeting that was broadcast in Greece. Based on those conditions, our country is not seeking and will not seek financial aid, either from our European partners or from the I.M.F., which would be our last resort.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Despite Mr. Papandreous brave talk, it is likely that some form of aid will be needed to help Greece raise the 53 billion euros, which includes 20 billion euros that is needed in April and May alone. And for Greece, as well as the European Union, the maneuvers Thursday amount to fiscal brinksmanship.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Greece would prefer that any financial help come from Europe, to avoid the embarrassment of turning to the I.M.F. But with voters in Germany and elsewhere strongly opposed to a bailout for what they see as a profligate government, European leaders want to see proof the Greek government is serious about cutting spending after years of living beyond its means.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Citing legal hurdles, a government official in Berlin said on Thursday that Germany believed that any external financial support to Athens would best be provided by the I.M.F.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the case that the Greeks get into really serious problems, we would support an I.M.F. solution, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Beside unsettling the markets, Greeces troubles have undermined
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/currency/euro/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; euro.=&quot;Euro.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   the euro
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , the common currency it and 15 and other European nations share.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Amid the uncertainty, the euro slipped against
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/currency/dollar/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; american=&quot;American&quot; dollar.=&quot;dollar.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   the dollar
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and was quoted at $1.3621 in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, down from $1.3741 early in the session. European stocks also wilted, with the Athens Stock Exchange General Index ending 3.4 percent lower.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Since the euros inception in 1999, no member has sought support from the I.M.F., which typically comes to the rescue of emerging-market economies rather than developed countries. The earlier offer of support for Greece did calm markets and take the spotlight off Greece, but European leaders have been vague about how any aid package would actually be structured.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Greek government, however, has been pushing for more clarity on what its neighbors will do in the hope of bringing down its borrowing costs, which have risen as Greeces debt troubles have become more acute.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The yield on Greeces benchmark 10-year bonds rose Thursday to 6.265 percent  a spread, or differential, of 3.14 percentage points over comparable German bonds, the European benchmark for safety.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germany says it believes that Athens can live with that premium, but the Greek government thinks it should not have to pay that much to borrow now that it has agreed to measures meant to cut its budget deficit to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. Greeces budget deficit hit 12.7 percent of G.D.P. last year, making it the worst gap in Europe.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If Athens relies on financing from the markets at high interest rates, that undermines the actual measures that you are taking, Mr. Papandreou said. That money then goes to the interest of those who are loaning to you rather than the implementation of a program.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The prime minister said that he still hoped for a positive response from Greeces neighbors at a meeting of European Union leaders next week in Brussels. We have kept all options open, he said.
 &lt;/p&gt;

  , both favor a European rescue effort rather than an I.M.F.-orchestrated one.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Already, the varying announcements from Berlin have left some politicians in Europe cold.  I find what has happened, or rather what has not happened over the past few days and weeks, incomprehensible, said Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and the current president of the Liberal Democratic bloc in the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_parliament/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; european=&quot;European&quot; parliament=&quot;Parliament&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   European Parliament
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . It is incomprehensible because it is precisely a European response that is the quickest and least costly solution.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In Washington, Caroline Atkinson, the I.M.F.s director of external relations, said on Thursday that the fund had not yet been approached by Athens.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We expect the euro-zone countries to want to and to plan to resolve this question by themselves, Ms. Atkinson said. She added that the I.M.F. was ready to respond to a request from Greece for a loan.

 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/info/germany?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; germany.=&quot;Germany.&quot; class=&quot;meta-loc&quot;&gt;
  Germany
 &lt;/a&gt;
 indicated on Tuesday that it might agree on an aid package for
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/greece/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; greece.=&quot;Greece.&quot; class=&quot;meta-loc&quot;&gt;
  Greece
 &lt;/a&gt;
 financed in part by the countries of the euro zone  but only as a last resort and subject to tough conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In an apparent attempt to set the terms of the debate among European leaders, Berlin made it clear that before it acted to bail out Greece, the Athens government would   have to exhaust its ability to borrow. Germany also said that any rescue would have to involve the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_monetary_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; international=&quot;International&quot; monetary=&quot;Monetary&quot; fund.=&quot;Fund.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
  International Monetary Fund
 &lt;/a&gt;
 . German and other European leaders will convene on Thursday in Brussels for a two-day summit meeting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 France and Spain made a proposal on Tuesday for the leaders of the 16 countries that use the euro to meet before the main meeting to talk about how to resolve the Greek situation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Germanys opposition to any bailout  has paralyzed the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; european=&quot;European&quot; union.=&quot;Union.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
  European Union
 &lt;/a&gt;
 . But in comments reported on Tuesday by Reuters and other news agencies, an unidentified senior German government official said that the condition for action, as a last resort, is that Greeces financing on the capital markets is exhausted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In addition, European countries would have to agree to negotiate additional instruments to enforce budget discipline, beyond the existing rules that allowed Greek finances to run out of control. That raised the possibility of a change to the European Unions governing treaties, something that would probably take several years to achieve.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In Brussels, the comments were seen as a signal that the German chancellor,
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/angela_merkel/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; angela=&quot;Angela&quot; merkel.=&quot;Merkel.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
  Angela Merkel
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , was now accepting that Greek problem  would dominate the meeting and that she wanted to set tough conditions on any declaration that was made.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkel faces strong public opposition in Germany to the idea of a bailout for Greece, which has asked for European Union backing to help in refinancing its debts at lower rates than the markets are requiring.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 One European official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/v/herman_van_rompuy/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; herman=&quot;Herman&quot; van=&quot;Van&quot; rompuy.=&quot;Rompuy.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
  Herman Van Rompuy
 &lt;/a&gt;
 , president of the European Council, was trying to coordinate a French-German agreement under which both European and I.M.F. money would be involved in any  rescue plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Whatever declaration emerges from the meeting, it is unlikely that it will give the kind of detail sought by Athens, which wants to know the terms under which any loans would be made.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The German statement that Greeces financing on the capital markets would have to be exhausted before a rescue also raised questions of definition. At some point, there would have to be a decision on what interest rates were impossible for Greece to pay, said one European diplomat who requested anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Meanwhile, in calling for new measures to reinforce budgetary discipline, Germany was potentially requesting a revision of the European Union treaties, though it was unclear how this would be linked to the immediate crisis in Greece.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 We will have to see what Merkel brings to Brussels, said one official not authorized to speak publicly. So far, these are comments by an official, not a formal statement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The chairman of the group of euro-area finance ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, who originally opposed the involvement of the I.M.F. in any Greek rescue, on Monday said the funds inclusion would not be a scandal.
&lt;/p&gt;

 , will decide Wednesday whether to propose formally a mechanism under which loans to Greece would be coordinated.
&lt;/p&gt;

 BRUSSELS  Resisting a bailout for Greece, digging in over economic policy and opposing parts of a strategy for Europes growth, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will arrive Thursday at a European Union summit meeting ready to play an unfamiliar role: the blocs naysayer.

   Angela Merkel, Germanys chancellor, said at a news conference in Berlin on Monday that investors shouldnt expect this weeks European Union summit to agree on assistance for Greece.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Once the invisible glue that bound the Union, German policy is now being dictated by less idealistic priorities rooted firmly by national interests.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The two-day meeting in Brussels will be shadowed by the Greek debt crisis, and Berlin is expected to agree to efforts to aid Athens only if it can impose strict conditions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile, Germany may find itself under pressure over its refusal to help its neighbors by stoking domestic economic demand, and over its objections to parts of a new European Union strategy to prompt higher growth in the next decade.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Berlins tough line over Greece, and a suggestion by Mrs. Merkel that a mechanism should be created to eject countries from the euro zone if they break the rules, has shocked its allies.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The debate in Germany over Greece is polluting the atmosphere and creating anti-European feeling, said Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister and leader of the centrist group ALDE in the European Parliament.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the space of a few weeks, we are destroying all our efforts to bring Europe closer together, Mr. Verhofstadt said Wednesday, adding that, after the reunification of the country, there is certainly a new Germany.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  German analysts have noticed the change, too. Joachim Fritz-Vannahme, Europe director of the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German research organization that focuses on democratic reform, said that Mrs. Merkel finds herself in opposition to more or less all of the E.U.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In a very prominent way, he added, the German government is saying, Our national interest comes first. We behave like all the others do.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germany was historically a main motor of European integration, a project conceived as one of Franco-German reconciliation in the aftermath of World War II.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But leaders of the largest economy in Europe, and therefore the biggest contributor to the Union, began to take a more assertive line more than a decade ago when Chancellor Helmut Kohl was replaced by Gerhard Schrder, a politician from a younger generation.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At times during her period in office, Mrs. Merkel has asserted strong European leadership  on climate change, for example  but todays crop of issues has prompted a different reflex.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This is certainly farewell to the Germany of Kohl, which was, at the end of the day, ready to pay with a check for stability within the E.U., Mr. Fritz-Vannahme said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Several factors are at play. Mrs. Merkels opposition to some of the targets proposed for the Unions 2020 economic strategy is based on Germanys constitutional arrangements. Education, one of the areas identified, is the responsibility of powerful regional administrators, whom Mrs. Merkel wants to consult before striking a deal.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  There are stresses, meanwhile, within the new coalition government that have led to deals apparently done by the countrys finance minister, Wolfgang Schuble, then being undone in Berlin.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But the deeper issues relate to Germanys economic policy.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Fearing that any bailout of Greece could break German constitutional or domestic law  and cost Berlin billions of euros  German support for any emergency mechanism is contingent on others meeting its tough terms.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Those terms include a statement that intervention would be a last resort, that the International Monetary Fund would be involved and that there will be new rules to prevent any repeat of the crisis.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  One E.U. diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly, asserted: The Germans are saying, We have had 10 years of the euro. What has happened is proof that this is not working.

  There has been a tectonic shift in the way Germany acts in Europe, said
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ecfr.eu/content/profile/C21&quot;&gt;
   Ulrike Gurot
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , a senior research fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. Germans, she says, are talking of behaving normally now, like the others, and that means nationally.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The European Union is facing a serious crisis over financing and its currency,
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/currency/euro/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; euro.=&quot;Euro.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   the euro
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . But France and Germany also have important disagreements on policy toward Russia, China and Iran, making a coherent European foreign policy increasingly difficult to discern on an array of critical issues.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The French and the Germans, with different domestic constituencies and different attitudes toward economic policy, have a different view of how Europe and the euro zone, the 16 nations that have adopted the euro as their currency,  should be managed. Germany, long the financier of the European Union, has made it clear that it will no longer pay for the mistakes and frauds of others.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  France has put a much stronger emphasis on European unity and pride, trying to avoid involving multilateral institutions like the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_monetary_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; international=&quot;International&quot; monetary=&quot;Monetary&quot; fund.=&quot;Fund.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   International Monetary Fund
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in the future of the euro, a prominent symbol of Europes challenge to the supremacy of the United States.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germany is no longer, as a matter of course or of principle, the motor, heart and savior of Europe, said
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmfus.org/experts/expert.cfm?id=1695&quot;&gt;
   Constanze Stelzenmller
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , a senior fellow of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. This isnt the Europe we signed up for. Its much larger, much poorer, and we have to take care of our own.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germany always acted in its interests, Ms. Gurot said, but those were perceived as sublimated within the European Union and
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/north_atlantic_treaty_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; the=&quot;the&quot; north=&quot;North&quot; atlantic=&quot;Atlantic&quot; treaty=&quot;Treaty&quot; organization.=&quot;Organization.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   NATO
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , the two postwar multilateral institutions that both protected the new democratic Germany and kept its ambitions in check. Now Germany is turning more obviously to Russia for energy and commercial interests, she said, making its European and American partners uneasy.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We sublimated hegemony, said Ms. Gurot, a German who is working on a paper called Germany Unbound. But were dropping the sublimation now. She laughed, then said: Of course, this doesnt sound nice to others.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Before a European Union summit meeting in Brussels last month on the Greek crisis, President
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/nicolas_sarkozy/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; nicolas=&quot;Nicolas&quot; sarkozy=&quot;Sarkozy&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Nicolas Sarkozy
  &lt;/a&gt;
  of France was reportedly in a rage, unable to push Mrs. Merkel toward a more explicit promise of help for
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/greece/index.html?inline=nyt-geo&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; news=&quot;news&quot; and=&quot;and&quot; information=&quot;information&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; greece.=&quot;Greece.&quot; class=&quot;meta-loc&quot;&gt;
   Greece
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Sarkozy yelled at the European Union president,
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/v/herman_van_rompuy/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; herman=&quot;Herman&quot; van=&quot;Van&quot; rompuy.=&quot;Rompuy.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Herman Van Rompuy
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , whom he summoned to Paris, European Union officials said. He threatened to boycott the summit meeting, while muttering that the Germans havent changed, according to French officials.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mrs. Merkel, for her part, remained calm as Mr. Sarkozy cooled down, but she stood by her position  that German taxpayers should not suffer for Greek mismanagement and laxity or set a precedent for future rescues of other weaker Mediterranean countries like Portugal, Spain and even Italy. Her stand, which included a role for the International Monetary Fund, created resentment in the rest of the euro zone, accustomed to German sacrifice for larger European political and economic goals.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  With a neo-liberal coalition partner, the Free Democrats, and with important elections coming next month in North Rhine-Westphalia, which could cost her ruling coalition control of the upper house in Berlin, Mrs. Merkel stood up for German interests and was hailed afterward at home.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  She also cited constitutional restraints against Germany bailing out other countries, concerns that France took as something of a pretext.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Criticism of German economic policy expresses a French malaise toward the growing gap between the two economies, and more generally toward this new Germany without which nothing is possible anymore in Europe, and which seems less and less likely to compromise if not in its national interests,
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iris-france.org/en/index.php&quot;&gt;
   Jacques-Pierre Gougeon
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , a Germany specialist at the French Institute for International and Strategic Relations, wrote in the newspaper Le Monde.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At the heart of the dispute is the euro. The French see it as the currency of a new, united Europe; the Germans see it as the direct descendant of the mark, and the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_central_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; european=&quot;European&quot; central=&quot;Central&quot; bank=&quot;Bank&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;
   European Central Bank
  &lt;/a&gt;
  as retaining the DNA of the Bundesbank, whose main task was to keep inflation down. The French favor a kind of European economic government, with easier rules on deficits; the Germans have no intention of giving up economic sovereignty to anyone, let alone to the French.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the Greek crisis, for example, Germany has insisted that any aid to Greece come as a last resort, and in the loan package arranged on Sunday it insisted that Greece pay a significant penalty in interest rates. This was well within Mrs. Merkels guidelines and does not represent a subsidy to Greece, said
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ecfr.eu/content/profile/C23&quot;&gt;
   Thomas Klau
  &lt;/a&gt;
  of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The German taxpayer is much more likely to make money from this deal than to lose it, and the agreement is within the framework of what she agreed upon in successive Brussels summits, he added.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germany also reacted angrily and defensively to a modest French suggestion by Finance Minister Christine Lagarde that the German export model had to change in the interests of other, less competitive euro zone countries, and that Germans should spend more buying the goods of their less fortunate neighbors.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germans, who have already undergone a wrenching structural reform and paid a huge bill to integrate the former eastern Germany, say they feel that theyre paying a significant personal price, Mr. Klau said. Poverty has increased considerably in Germany and is now a social reality. And it makes Germany more inward-looking than the old West Germany, and a more defensive country.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Part of the change is generational, with Mrs. Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, representing those born after World War II, with only anecdotal knowledge of Nazi Germany. The members of Parliament are even younger, many of them teenagers or younger when the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/berlin_wall/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; berlin=&quot;Berlin&quot; wall.=&quot;Wall.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   Berlin Wall
  &lt;/a&gt;
  fell in 1989.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  So the German leadership paradigm from Konrad Adenauer through
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/helmut_kohl/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; helmut=&quot;Helmut&quot; kohl.=&quot;Kohl.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Helmut Kohl
  &lt;/a&gt;
  roughly 1949 to 1989, when Germany was a crucial junior partner both for NATO and European integration  is gone. When Germany steps out of the film, it changes, Ms. Gurot said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Despite symbolic efforts to bring Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel together  unveiling joint projects at the Arc de Triomphe last February or a recent stunt of having Ms. Lagarde sit in on a German cabinet meeting  With the French we have more that divides us than unites us, Ms. Gurot said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germans feel they have paid both their reparations and their dues, and many times over, said Ms. Stelzenmller, especially in an uncertain time of globalization and financial crisis. People want to be normal, in the sense that other people dont come to us first and say, You have to pay. And it doesnt have much to do with political orientation. All of us are huddling with our backs against the storm.

&lt;p&gt;
 BERLIN  Germany no longer seems satisfied playing the role of the gentle giant of Europe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 As Chancellor Angela Merkel traveled Monday to the United States for a series of meetings across the country, she is now seen by her European and American counterparts as a leader reluctant to commit her nation to its traditional posture in Europe of Continental paymaster and cooperative solution-seeker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 In the past, Germany gave in to Europe, said Nicolaus Heinen, an economic and European policy analyst at Deutsche Bank Research. There was a social consensus due to the huge economic gains from the internal market.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 But now that the war generation is stepping down, and Germany increasingly recognizes the new role it plays in Europe after reunification, Mr. Heinen said, this consensus is over, both in the Chancellery and among voters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 If post-1945 Germany nurtured its international legitimacy in the gray collective identity forged in the precursors to the European Union, under Mrs. Merkel the tendency in Berlin has been more to try to dictate policy than seek consensus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 This has been clearly on display in the well-chronicled financial crisis over Greece, where Mrs. Merkel had fought assiduously against any large-scale bailout. A package was finally hammered out Sunday after E.U. officials agreed over the weekend to lend Greece 30 billion, or about $41 billion, if necessary; but even there, Germany is going out of its way to insist that the deal does not mean any special favors for Athens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Yet Germanys shift is equally important behind the scenes, in the corridors where E.U. politics are played out in Brussels. Berlin has been increasingly pressing the point that it carries too much of the E.U. burden, undermining many of assumptions Europe operated under during the Cold War.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Since the Berlin Wall fell 20 years ago, Germany has not only absorbed the former Communist East but also undertaken serious welfare reforms. Although the old West Germany was willing to finance European integration, the new post-reunification nation sees things differently.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Germany is now a poorer country than it was, said Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Despite its successes as an export machine, per capita income is lower and poverty is a significant factor which it was not pre-unification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Very painful medicine had to be taken, Mr. Klau added, to make Germany fit for globalization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It was different under Helmut Kohl, the conservative chancellor who led Germany through unification and was emotionally and politically committed to European integration as well. He even agreed to give up the much-loved Deutsche mark to create a common European currency, a powerful signal of his willingness to subsume Germany within a stronger and more united Europe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Germanys changing role, analysts say, reflects the passing of the torch between generations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mr. Kohls successor, the Social Democrat Gerhard Schrder, 66, started changing course. Less committed to Europe, he was also more willing to defend German interests in Brussels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkel, 55, reared in Eastern Germany, has turned Germany even more into a defender of its own national interests, while shifting attention away from the post-World War II alliance with France to a greater focus on Eastern and Central Europe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 If you look at the changes which have taken place from Kohl to Schrder and now to Merkel, the technocrats have taken over E.U. policy from the visionaries, Mr. Heinen said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Mrs. Merkels visit, four days and her longest to America since taking office nearly five years ago, will take her to Washington for a nuclear disarmament summit meeting, Hollywood for entertainment and Stanford University for an honorary degree.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 It will be a welcome break from the homegrown problems and questions about her leadership style that have cost her  and her center-right coalition government  a striking loss of public confidence in recent polls. Perhaps that helps explain Mrs. Merkels intense interest in defending Germanys longstanding and deeply emotional commitment to economic stability, low inflation and financial discipline, even if it means accepting slower growth and imposing harsh fiscal conditions on its European partners. Such a policy also serves to sustain Germanys export-oriented economy at the expense of encouraging greater consumer spending.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 No German politician could ever afford to jeopardize monetary stability, Mr. Heinen added. Such stability is important for German industry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Officials in Brussels play down this new, more assertive stance from Berlin. They argue that Mrs. Merkel is behaving in a way intended to defuse a more populist mood in Germany .

  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Many beleaguered former West Germans, the stalwarts of European integration before the countrys reunification, are increasingly asking what is in it for them. The repercussions for Europe and the stability of financial markets worldwide could be enormous.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Voters in the Ruhr rust-belt region of North Rhine-Westphalia will have the chance this weekend to vent their frustration at Chancellor
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/angela_merkel/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; angela=&quot;Angela&quot; merkel.=&quot;Merkel.&quot; class=&quot;meta-per&quot;&gt;
   Angela Merkel
  &lt;/a&gt;
  for pushing the bailout package through Parliament on Friday. Even before the drama in Athens, the fatigue was evident from helping to shoulder the financial burden of rebuilding eastern Germany, as the heavy industry they depended on for their livelihood bled away.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germanys nearly $30 billion share of the bailout deal for Greece    and with it the fear that other countries on the periphery of the euro zone like Portugal and Spain wont be far behind    comes after the country spent an estimated $2 trillion to build up the former East Germany since the historic fall of the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/berlin_wall/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More&quot; articles=&quot;articles&quot; about=&quot;about&quot; berlin=&quot;Berlin&quot; wall.=&quot;Wall.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;
   Berlin Wall
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in 1989.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Its been like this for 20 years, said Walter Schmidt, 71, a retired mechanic out shopping in the Ruhr city of Bochum this week who is opposed to helping Greece. Germany has its own debts. And the Ruhr is now very poor.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The recent plunge in stock markets and the fall of the euro against the dollar have been driven in large part by the fear that Germany would not help cover the debts of overburdened euro zone members, given how grudgingly and slowly the assistance for Greece came. The opposition Social Democrats, who hope to return to power in North Rhine-Westphalia, told members to abstain from the vote in the Bundestag on Friday.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mrs. Merkel won passage of the legislation to support Greece despite several members of her party breaking ranks and voting against it. She has been roundly criticized by bailout opponents for what they deem a giveaway to the irresponsible Greeks, a majority opinion in Germany, but also by supporters for delaying the rescue and, in their view, fueling instability in the financial markets raising the price tag. Adding to her concerns, a group of academics Friday challenged the constitutionality of the bailout before the countrys highest court in Karlsruhe.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As she meets with European leaders in Brussels Friday night, Mrs. Merkel must hope that the election in North Rhine-Westphalia remains focused on local issues like education and does not become the day popular anger boils over. A loss in Germanys most populous state would not just damage her politically, but could also cost her governing coalition its majority in the upper house of Parliament, making it difficult to advance her economic agenda.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The left-leaning bloc of the Social Democrats and the Green Party had edged ahead of the conservative team of the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats, Mrs. Merkels ruling coalition on the federal level, in recent polls.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Ive lived in this state for 20 years and Ive never seen the people so concerned about the future, about the economic and the social situation, said Franz Lehner, professor of applied social science at the Ruhr University of Bochum. The capability to survive of these cities is really at stake, said Mr. Lehner.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As an unseasonably frigid rain fell Thursday in Bochum, Dirk Schmidt, 35, a local party leader for Mrs. Merkels conservatives campaigned for a seat in the state legislature at the Hannibal shopping center. He was greeted with support from party members but also derision.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The party disappointed me once with the east, an old man pushing a shopping cart shouted as one of Mr. Schmidts campaign workers offered him a flier. I wont pay a cent for the Greeks.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mr. Schmidt said he did not believe Greece would be a decisive issue in the election, but that people mix everything in one pot, local, federal and international issues merging with the daily concerns of households. Greece is cursed a great deal. They say, My pension is being cut and were giving money for Greece, said Mr. Schmidt.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Bochum watched its Nokia cellphone factory pick up stakes two years ago and move to Romania, with more than 2,000 jobs melting away in its wake. The carmaker

  &lt;/a&gt;
  , which once employed 25,000 people in the city, today provides work for around 5,000 people, jobs that are also in jeopardy as Opels corporate parent,

   General Motors
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , restructures its subsidiary.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Unemployment is 10.2 percent in Bochum, lower than in nearby Essen or Dortmund, but well above the national rate of 8.1 percent. You wouldnt believe how many old people, normally dressed, are collecting bottles in front of the train station, said Johannes Henke, 40, a Bochum taxi driver standing under the shopping center overhang to stay out of the rain.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Like municipalities throughout the Ruhr, the city government is in deep fiscal trouble. According to Paul Aschenbrenner, the Bochum city director, the city was 1.4 billion euros in debt, or 3,690 euros for each resident. The government has been forced to cut municipal jobs, reduce the opening hours and increase prices at sports facilities and raise fees at music schools.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Yet last year the city paid 9.1 million euros to help with projects in the former East Germany, part of the 228 million euros it has paid in the 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Mr. Aschenbrenner said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Christian Haardt, a Bochum city council member from Mrs. Merkels party and also a candidate in the state election, stood on the bridge over University Street this week, handing out coffee in orange CDU cups to students on their way to classes. Many people, myself included, are making a fist in their pockets, said Mr. Haardt, who has had to answer constituent e-mail asking why Germany is paying for Greece.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  And were barely able to fill potholes, Mr. Haardt said with a sigh.

   Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, right, and other politicians cast their votes on the European debt rescue package in Berlin on Friday.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;readerscomment&quot; class=&quot;inlineLeft&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It was an uncomfortably close call for Mrs. Merkel. The bill passed by a margin of just seven votes, with half a dozen members of her conservative coalition voting against. The left-wing opposition parties refused to support the deal, either abstaining or voting against it.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The vote answered the question, for now at least, of whether Germany is committed to seeking European solutions to the fiscal crisis facing the continent. It came at the end of a week that saw sharp divisions emerge over the German governments decision to introduce unilateral measures to dampen financial-market speculation,  and to do so without consulting its European partners.The German Finance Ministrys actions, including a partial ban on so-called naked short-selling, were designed to placate a German public fed up with bailouts, whether for other countries or for financial institutions widely viewed as profiting from the present instability.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But the crisis of confidence in the euro, which has weakened the currency and shaken markets around the world, is not just about underlying economic fundamentals. At its heart, it concerns the ability of European leaders to work in concert. And the German decision to go-it-alone reinforced the negative impression of a divided Europe at a delicate juncture.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But in Germany, where Mrs. Merkel is still trying to recover from her partys
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/world/europe/10germany.html&quot; title=&quot;Times&quot; article=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
   election defeat
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in Germanys most populous state earlier this month, the unilateral measures were viewed as a necessary step to win passage of the rescue plan in the Bundestag.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As a consequence of the overheated public debate the German government needed to take action to show we are doing something against financial speculation before the Bundestag vote, said Ulrike Gurot, director of the Berlin office of the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecfr.eu&quot;&gt;
   European Council on Foreign Relations
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . It was a very controversial debate, but the vote is done so I guess Germany is coming back to its European convictions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germanys share of the safety net could reach $183 billion, the largest share of any European country. After meeting with the new prime minister of Britain, David Cameron, in Berlin, Mrs. Merkel called it an important day for the German Parliament.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But criticism was widespread here.  It is a question of one of the gravest errors of decision in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, Hans-Werner Sinn, the president of the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/ifoHome&quot;&gt;
   Ifo Institute
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in Munich and a prominent economist, told the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Potential irritations in the capital markets, which would stay within limits, are of lesser importance compared to the harm to Germany that a too-hasty decision would bring about.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Mrs. Merkels leadership was called into question not only by leading opposition politicians but by members of her own bloc. Horst Seehofer, state premier in Bavaria and head of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Mrs. Merkels Christian Democrats, told the daily Sddeutsche Zeitung that too much power had been shifted to Europe at the expense of the German Parliament, and that other alternatives should have been explored months earlier.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Germany is the main financer of the rescue plan, Mr. Seehofer said. The people expect that their representatives will not disenfranchise themselves.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  State leaders like Mr. Seehofer, aware of public sentiment and fearful that they will suffer politically as the Christian Democrats did in the election in North Rhine-Westphalia, used the debate over the rescue plan to distance themselves from a chancellor in trouble. Its similar to a panic reaction, to leaving the sinking ship, Claus Leggewie, a political scientist at the Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities in Essen.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Shes being attacked regularly, said Mr. Leggewie. Angela Merkel is not someone who really had her party in hand. She was only untouchable as long as she was successful.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  After years of enduring stagnant wages and pensions, and watching the retirement age delayed to 67 from 65, Germans are angered at the prospect of  paying the debts of what they see as profligate states like Greece. Fearing the reaction of voters at home, Mrs. Merkel resisted President

   financial crisis
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The current debate goes beyond the emergency bailout for indebted nations to questions about  the future of economic integration among the countries using the euro currency. The bloc has neither a common fiscal policy nor a consensus of how best to balance stability and growth. Many members, including France, feel that Germanys historic fear of inflation has led to a monetary policy that has unduly restricted economic growth.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In terms of ideology, Germany is blind in the

  eye and France is blind in the inflation eye, said Ms. Gurot of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Its about economic cultures, how you want to organize your societies and your social cohesion. And its hard to find the appropriate mechanism because it goes right to the heart of how your society is structured.
